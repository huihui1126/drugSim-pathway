Mitochondrial complex I assembly model OXPHOS system	This pathway shows how all 45 different subunits are assembled into complex 1 (relevant for the electron transport chain, also known as OXPHOS system), which chaperones(visualised with a small circle and a "C') and which post-translational modifications (a dimethylation on NDUFS2 and hydroxylation on NDUFS7, both in the Q-module) are needed for this assemblyMost of the steps involved in this intricate process have been described in separate literature references, which have been combined in a review by Alba Signes and Erika Fernandez-Vizarra[https://doi.org/10.1042/EBC20170098]. If possible (based on the size of the protein in KD and available protein structures in Uniprot), the colour of the protein structure drawings have been matched to the annotated protein DataNodesAbbreviations: IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space.	
IL-6 signaling pathway	IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with important role in immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation and oncogenesis. IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via the signal transducer gp130 that associates with IL6R in a cooperative manner to form a hexameric signal transducing complex, capable of activating the down stream mediators of this signaling pathway. This mechanism of signal transduction is shared by other members of the IL-6 type cytokines like IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 that use gp130 as a common subunit of the signal transducing complex. IL-6 stimulation leads to the activation of JAK/STAT pathway. Both STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated and are able to form homo- and heterodimers after activation leading to their nuclear localization and subsequent regulation of transcription of respective target genes. SHP-2 is one of the ubiquitous tyrosine phosphatases and IL-6 stimulation leads to the SHP2-dependent activation of MAPKs, it also links the Grb2-SOS complex and Gab1 to gp130. Phosphorylated Gab1 acts as an adapter and is involved in the indirect association of SHP-2 and PI-3 kinase. Downstream activation of Vav1, Rac-1 and MAP2K4 is necessary for the IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation to accomplish its effects. STAT3 is also phosphorylated by PKCD and it causes inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. PTPN11 and SOCS3 exert inhibitory function and thus lead to down regulation of the signaling cascade.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_6_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Fluoropyrimidine Activity	The main mechanism of 5-FU activation is conversion to fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) which inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS), an important part of the folate-homocysteine cycle and purine and pyrimidine synthesis The conversion of 5-FU to FdUMP can occur via thymidylate phosphorylase (TYMP) to fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) and then by the action of thymidine kinase to FdUMP or indirectly via fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) or fluroridine (FUR) to fluorouridine diphosphate (FUDP) and then ribonucleotide reductase action to FdUDP and FdUMP. FUDP and FdUDP can also be converted to FUTP and FdUTP and incorporated into RNA and DNA respectively which also contributes to the pharmacodynamic actions of fluoropyrimidines.Sources: [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA150653776 PharmGKB:Fluoropyrimidine Pharmacokinetics], [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA165291507 PharmGKB:Fluoropyrimidine Pharmacodynamics], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil Wikipedia:Fluorouracil]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1601 CPTAC Assay Portal]	SLC29A1,CES1,DHFR,GGH,ABCC3,CDA,ABCC4,DPYD,RRM2,RRM1,MIR29C,PPAT,ERCC2,UPP1,SLC22A7,DPYS,TP53,ABCC5,CYP2A6,TYMP,UCK2,MTHFR,SMUG1,UCK1,TK1,ABCG2,FPGS,TDG,XRCC3,TYMS,CES2,UPB1,UMPS,UPP2

TCA Cycle and Deficiency of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase complex (PDHc)	When transported into the inner mitochondrial matrix, pyruvate encounters two principal metabolizing enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase, PC (a gluconeogenic enzyme) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the first enzyme of the PDH complex (PDHc). With a high cell-energy charge, co-enzyme A (CoA) is highly acylated, principally as acetyl-CoA, and able to obligately activate pyruvate carboxylase, directing pyruvate toward gluconeogenesis. When the energy charge is low, CoA is not acylated, therefore, pyruvate carboxylase is inactive, and pyruvate is preferentially metabolized via the PDHc and the TCA cycle to CO2 and H2O. The acetyl-CoA produced by the PDHc enters the TCA cycle and the reduced electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) that are generated during the oxidative reactions can then be used to drive ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylationDescription source: [https://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/tca-cycle.php The Medical Biochemistryp Page]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2453 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Disorders of Folate Metabolism and Transport	Folates play an essential role in one-carbon methyl transfer reactions, mediating several biological processes (e.g. DNA synthesis, epigentics by methylation, embryonic central nervous system development, cata-/anabolism of amino acids, and anabolism of thymidines, purines, and neurotransmitters. The biologically active folic acid derivative is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF). Dietary folate is absorbed in the intestine, and stored in the liver for few months.

Estrogen metabolism	Estrogens are metabolized via hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and via conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases (sulfation) and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (glucuronidation). In addition, estradiol is dehydrogenated by 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into the much less potent estrogen estrone. These reactions occur primarily in the liver, but also in other tissuesDescription source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen#Metabolism Wikipedia].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP697 CPTAC Assay Portal]	COMT,CYP3A4,SULT1A1,UGT1A3,UGT1A1,SULT1E1,ARSD,CYP1B1,ARSC,CYP1A2,NQO1,CYP1A1,UGT1A8,UGT2B7,GSTA1,UGT1A9,GSTM1,ARSE
Hypothesized Pathways in Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Disease	The pathways hypothesized to be involved in  cardiovascular diseases begin with LTBPs and Fibrillins activating a TGFBR complex. The complex can begin the canonical TGFB pathway involving SMAD proteins that target gene expression for proteins involved in endocardial and epicardial EMT, neural crest migration, ECM remodeling, cell differentiation, development and maintenance of cardiovascular structure and function. The non-canonical TGFB pathway involves the calcium-calneurin signaling pathway that also affects the previously mentioned functions. the TGFBR complex also activates SHCA and Tak1 which promote the function of a complex (ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38) to regulate the previously mentioned cell functions and influence the development of cardiovascular diseases. These diseases are additionally influenced by a signalling pathway involving the activation of TGFB ligands, receptors, activators, and effectors by ANG2/AT1/2R complex.

TGF-beta Receptor Signalling in Skeletal Dysplasias	This diagram shows which skeletal dysplasias are caused by abnormalities in in TGF-beta signalling. The diagram is based on pathway: [[Pathway:WP560|TGF-beta Receptor Signaling (Homo sapiens)]].Dotted arrows indicates that a disease is caused by mutation in the respective gene.The exact role of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2 is currently unknown, they are known to interact with FBN1.The Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

SRF and miRs in Smooth Muscle Differentiation and Proliferation	Smooth muscle cells exhibit a unique plasticity, in that they are able to oscillate between proliferative and more quiescent, differentiated states. These two states are determined, in part, by a network of transcription factors, including Klf-4, Elk-1 and serum response factor (SRF), that regulate expression of genes controlling smooth muscle cell status. Two smooth muscle-enriched, co-transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-143 and miR-145, cooperatively target this transcription factor network to promote smooth muscle cell differentiation. miR-145 also acts in a positive feed-foward regulatory loop to enhance expression of the smooth muscle regulator, Myocardin (Myocd), which cooperates with SRF to activate transcription of miR-143/145. Conversely, the cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-133, which is also under transcriptional control of both SRF and Mef2C, acts in a negative feed-back loop to decrease SRF translation. Other miRNAs, including miR-214 and miR-199a, also target SRF, limiting its activity in specific cell types.	NKX2-5,MEF2D,KLF4,ELK1,MEF2B,MEF2C,CAMK2D,MYOCD,CCND2,SRF,MEF2A
EPO Receptor Signaling	The erythropoietin receptor is a 66 kDa peptide and is a member of the cytokine receptor family. The receptor is tyrosine phosphorylated upon binding by erythropoietin and associates with and activates the tyrosine kinase, JAK2, which activates different intracellular pathways including: Ras/MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and STAT transcription factors. The stimulated erythropoietin receptor appears to have a role in erythroid cell survival. Defects in the erythropoietin receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial ALS (FALS) cases, is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins. Nitration may target neurofilament proteins, affecting axonal transport. Collectively, these mechanisms are predicted to disturb cellular homeostasis, ultimately triggering motor neuron death.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2447 CPTAC Assay Portal]	BAD,TP53,NEFH,SOD1,BAX,BCL2L1,PPP3CC,NOS1,RAC1,BID,PPP3CB,NEFL,ASK1,MKK3,CASP12,TNFR,CASP3,TNFalpha,PRPH,p38,NEFM,BCL2,APAF1,DAXX,CAT,GPX1,CASP9,RAB5A,CASP1,PPP3CA,MKK6,CCS,ALS2
GABA receptor Signaling	GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. It is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. The GABA transporter GAT, located in the plasma membrane of nerve terminals and glial cells, plays an important role in the termination of synaptic transmission. GABA enters the cell via GAT and is then converted to gamma hydroxybutarate or succinate, the latter eventually entering the citrate cycle.There are three GABA receptors: GABA(A), GABA(B) and GABA(C) receptor. GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors belong to the family of transmitter-gated ion channels while GABA(B) receptor is a G protein coupled receptor which is activated by baclofen. GABA(A) receptors are hetero-oligomeric Cl- channels that are modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. GABA(A)R-associated protein (GABARAP) is localized in the golgi and plays a role in intracellular GABA (A) receptor transport via its ability to interact with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and gephyrin (GPHN). Surface receptor number is important since it is a determinant of inhibitory synapse strength. It is controlled by removal of receptors from the membrane by interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 followed by recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. GABA(A) receptors can then be targeted for proteasomal degradation.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4159 CPTAC Assay Portal]	ALDH9A1,SLC6A11,AP2A1,GABARAP,GAT1,AP2A2,DNM1,GAD2,GPHN,NSF,ABAT,AP2S1,UBQLN1,AP2B1,AP2M1,GAD1,SLC32A1

Ang II activates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 to induce aldosterone synthesis, increasing water and salt resorption and potassium excretion in the kidney and increasing blood pressure.Source: PharmGKB (https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA2023)Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP554 CPTAC Assay Portal]	AGTR2,TGFB1,AGTR1,AGT,MAS1,ACE,ATP6AP2,BDKRB2,CYP11B2,ACE2,CTSG,NOS3,TFs,REN,KNG1,BDKRB1,CMA1,NR3C2
ATR Signaling	This pathway is modeled after Figure 1 in the article " ATR signalling: more than meeting at the fork" (See Bibliography). This pathway details the ATR signaling which commences when there is a gap in the single strand DNA. It details the usage of several independent checkpoint proteins which then cause TOPBP1 dependent activation of the phosphorylation and kinase of a large number of substrates including CHK1 to commence regulation of cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress.

Chromosomal and microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer 	CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).This pathway is based on information from [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map05210 KEGG]The most common mutation in colon cancer is inactivation of APC. When APC does not have an inactivating mutation, frequently there are activating mutations in β-catenin. In order for cancer to develop, both alleles must be mutated. Mutations in APC or β-catenin must be followed by other mutations to become cancerous; however, in carriers of an APC inactivating mutations, the risk of colorectal cancer by age 40 is almost 100%.The impact of KRAS mutations is heavily dependent on the order of mutations. Primary KRAS mutations generally lead to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion, but if they occur after a previous APC mutation it often progresses to cancer. KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to panitumumab and cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer. Currently, the most reliable way to predict whether a colorectal cancer patient will respond to one of the EGFR-inhibiting drugs is to test for certain “activating” mutations in the gene that encodes KRAS, which occurs in 30%–50% of colorectal cancers. Studies show patients whose tumors express the mutated version of the KRAS gene will not respond to cetuximab or panitumumab. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS#Colorectal_cancer Wikipedia]DCC can be considered a conditional tumor suppressor gene as well as a conditional oncogene. When DCC is present and not activated by netrin it is proapoptotic, and represses tumor formation. When DCC is present and netrin-activated it promotes cell survival, acting as an oncoprotein. One of the most frequent genetic abnormalities that occur in advanced colorectal cancer is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of DCC in region 18q21. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleted_in_Colorectal_Cancer Wikipedia][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736321 de Miranda et al] suggest that TGFβ signaling remains active in some CRC cells with MSI mutations in the TGFBR2 gene, because the mutated gene still expresses a functional protein. Aberrant overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is thought to have an important role in development of CRC. The tumorigenic effects of COX-2 can be attributed to the production of PGE2; increased levels of PGE2 have been reported in colorectal adenomas as well as carcinomas. COX-2 and PGE2 regulate proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion in colorectal tumors.

Notch Signaling	The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in all metazoan organisms in the Animal kingdom. The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP268 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Hepatitis B infection	The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a virus in the Hepadnaviridae family which infects hepatocytes in the liver. It causes both acute and chronic infections, and prolonged chronic infection can lead to complications such as cirrhosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The left side of the pathway describes the pathogenesis of HBV. The virus binds NTCP (SLC10A1) and is subsequently endocytosed. It is transported to the nucleus where viral polymerase creates covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Using the host RNA polymerase, this is transcribed into viral mRNAs. Viral DNA polymerase then synthesizes viral DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity. Assembled viral particles exit the cell via the ESCRT pathway.The HBV regulatory protein HBx interferes with many cellular processes including transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle progress, protein degradation, apoptosis and chromosomal stability.

Regucalcin in proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells	This pathway includes the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells (NRK52E cell) with a basolateral and apical side and other schematic illustrated organelles involved in the process of kidney function. The influence of regucalcin on the intra-and extracellular Ca2+ regulation is showed which are both involved in cell proliferation, ion transport and apoptosis and are important in normal kidney function. When the regulation of regucalcin and other factors are downregulated and suppressed the kidney fails in functionality and so renal fibrosis will developFirst of all, TNF-B and TNF-a do have an impact on the activity of Smad which has an impact on the development of a-SMA that induced renal fibrosis. NF-kB, stimulated by TNF-a, activates the transcription factor p65 that induced the IL-8 expression which is involved in inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, regucalcin inhibits the a-SMA which means that the formation of renal fibrosis is inhibited. Further, TNF-B stimulates the caspase 8 that activates the cytochrome C which activate the apoptosis pathway. Also, here regucalcin function as an inhibitor for Apaf1 that results in an inhibition of the apoptosis pathway and activate the Bcl-2 (suppressor of apoptotic cell death). Besides the TNF-B and TNF-a pathway, there is an RTK pathway illustrated which activates the PI3K and RAS pathway for stimulation of the protein and cell proliferation. According to Yamaguchi M. (2015), regucalcin activates the Akt1 to induce the protein proliferation even further when PI3K is inhibited. The RTK pathway shows interaction with the cAMP pathway that stimulate the protein kinase A and the PIP2 pathway that stimulate the protein kinase C and IP3. These all will stimulate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This Ca2+ can migrate and enters the mitochondria through the Ca2+ uniporter which results in the activation of mitochondrial biological processes or release of different mitochondrial factors. Hence, calcium controls and modulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. MAP3K pathway might be involved in the stimulation of RAF1 to induce the cell proliferation and the increase in apoptosis by inhibition of Bcl-2 through JNK which is also activated by ROS. Ca2+ released by the ER can also bind to calmodulin to form the Ca2+/calmodulin complex that stimulates IP3, JNK, NOS, RGPR—p117 and NF1. The latter two proteins are involved in the enhancement of regucalcin gene expression. On the other hand, regucalcin can inhibit the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin complex and the NOS. Normally, phosphodiesterase binds cAMP that induced the degradation of cAMP which results in a decrease of protein kinase A that leads to a reduction of ER Ca2+ release. Regucalcin inhibits the phosphodiesterase in such a way that cAMP will not be degraded and the ER Ca2+ release can further occur. Remaining Ca2+ released from the ER can also transport to the microsomes, enters vis Ca2+ uniporter, to induce microsomal activities. This process of microsomal Ca2+ uptake can be diminished through the inhibition of IP3 kinase. Regucalcin is not only involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ release or uptake, but also extracellular Ca2+ by stimulating the Ca2+/ATPase which leads to Ca2+ export. Besides that, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is important to be present on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cell to regulate the ion transport. On the apical membrane is the TRPV5 receptor present that regulate the import of Ca2+ from the lumen back into the kidney cell, but Ca2+ can also travel via paracellular transport. Further, in the nucleus the regucalcin has an influence on the inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphate (PSP), tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and calcineurin gene expression. Normally, PSP stimulates the protein kinase A- and so the ER Ca2+ release-, PTP stimulates the cell growth and differentiation and calcineurin will migrate to the cytoplasm for binding to the Ca2+ and stimulates the formation of Ca2+/calmodulin complex. In general, regucalcin regulates the factors and proteins involved in ion transport, cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Ovarian Infertility Genes	Ovarian bottleneck genes associated with infertilityA valuable approach to the study of infertility is the comparison of mutations of individual human and mouse genes associated with infertility phenotypes. The individual gene pages in the OKdb (Ovarian Kaleidoscope Database: http://ovary.stanford.edu) contain information on associated fertility phenotypes sorted by ovarian and nonovarian defects and by subfertility or infertility. If one searches for null mutations (under mutation type) causing infertility (infertile - ovarian defect, under female fertility status) in mice (under species), 44 gene entries are found. The expression of these infertility genes in the oocyte and granulosa cells together with their cellular localization is presented in Ovarian Infertility gene map.

Overview of interferons-mediated signaling pathway	Interferons (IFNs) can be devided in three classes, Type I, II and III. Type I IFNs are created when the cell surface or specific receptors recognize microbial products; these are structural homologues of one another which bind the same receptor. Binding to this receptor leads to an activation of kinases which regulate the phosphorylation and therefore activation of some STAT proteins (see PW for details).There is only 1 Type II interferon, INF-gamma, consisting of two subunits (R1 and R2), which associate with Jak 1 and 2, respectively. Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 leads to phosphorylation of STAT1, which ultimately binds to IFN-gamma-activated sequence (GAS) elements, regulating the transcription of genes. Type III interferons are considered a protein family of 4, which bind to a different receptor compared to Type I interferons, however they trigger the same STAT1+2 phosphorylation reactions as TypeI IFNs.

Glycogen Synthesis and Degradation	Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself. '''Glycogen synthesis''' is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1-&gt;4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1-&gt;4) to (a1-&gt;6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.'''Glycogen degradation''' consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.Information partly derived from "Biochemistry" by Stryer and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen Wikipedia].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP500 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PYGM,PHKB,PPP2R2A,PPP2R5E,CALM2,GYS2,CALM1,PPP2R5B,CALM3,PPP2R3A,PYGB,PPP2R2B,UGP2,PHKA2,PGM1,AGL,GYG,PPP2R5D,PYG,PYGL,PPP2CA,GYS1,PHKG1,PPP2R1B,GYG2,PHKA1,hexokinase,GSK3A,GSK3B,PPP2R1A,PPP2CB,GBE1,PPP2R5A,PHKG2,PPP2R5C,PPP2R4,PPP2R2C,PPP2R3B
ESC Pluripotency Pathways	The cytokine LIF and its downstream effector STAT3 are essential for maintenance of pluripotency in mouse ES cells. The requirement for the transcription factor Oct3/4 for ES cell pluripotency is also well-documented. However, LIF is not involved in self-renewal of human ES cells, suggesting that other pathways must play an important role in this process. The importance of other signal transduction pathways, including BMP and Wnt signalings, as well as novel transcription factors such as Nanog, is now being recognized.Pathway source: Intracellular Signaling Pathways Regulating Pluripotency of Embryonic Stem Cells, Okita et al, Current Stem Cell Research and Therapy, 2006, 1, 103-111.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3931 CPTAC Assay Portal]	SMAD4,WNT7B,MAP2K5,FGF20,FZD6,FGF10,FGF23,FZD5,DVL1,MAP2K3,FGF6,FGF14,PDGFRB,FGFR3,FGF1,JUN,SMAD5,FZD7,EGFR,STAT3,WNT5A,FZD3,FGF18,DVL2,LRP6,LIF,FGFR2,BMPR1A,ACTR2,Myc,PTEN,SMAD9,DVL3,WNT11,BRAF,GAB1,PIK3CD,ELK1,MAP2K6,FZD4,GRB2,MAPK12,FGF3,FZD9,MAP2K2,FGF13,ERAS,MTOR,FGF8,FGF19,WNT9B,WNT1,JAK1,FGF21,PDGFA,FGF9,AKT1,actr2b,MAPK4,HNF1A,LRP5,ARAF,WNT16,WNT5B,MDM2,CTNNB1,MAP2K1,ACVR1,SMAD7,FGF7,PIK3R2,FGF16,BMP4,SMAD1,WNT3A,HRAS,WNT6,MAPK1,SOS1,EGF,WNT10B,AKT3,WNT4,FGF22,WNT10A,FGFR1,RAF1,AXIN1,PDGFRA,WNT2,FGF5,BMPR1B,FZD8,FZD2,MAPK7,SELENOP,NOG,FGF17,BMPR2,SMAD6,APC,FGF2,WNT3,IL6ST,FOS,WNT2B,PDGFB,AKT2,FGFR4,MAPK6,FGF12,PTPN11,LIFR,FGF4,WNT7A,GSK3B,FZD1,FGF11

IL-7 Signaling Pathway	Interleukin-7 (IL-7) was discovered in the year 1988 as a factor that enhanced the growth of murine B-cell precursors in bone marrow culture system. It was also known as lymphopoietin 1and pre-B cell factor. IL-7 plays an important role in the development of B and T cells in mouse and T cells in humans. It is also essential for mature and naive T-cell's survival and proliferation. Human IL-7 gene maps to chromosome 8 and is about 72kb in length. The protein encoded by this gene is 177 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 20 kDa. The active form of IL-7 in humans is a glycoprotein of 25 kDa. In humans IL-7 has been shown to be produced from intestinal epithelial cells, keratinocytes , hepatic tissues, peripheral blood dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The IL-7 receptor consists of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7RÎ±) and a common gamma chain (Î³c). The gamma chain is also shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors. The signaling pathways activated upon IL-7 binding to the receptor complex are JAK-STAT, PI-3 kinase and Src kinase pathways. JAK3, a protein tyrosine kinase is constitutively associated with the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain. Studies in mice lacking JAK3 have shown that it is required for transducing Î³c dependent signals. Mutations in JAK3 and Î³c have been shown to be associated with the autosomal recessive form of T-B + SCID. JAK1, another protein tyrosine kinase is associated with IL-7RÎ± chain and is activated upon IL-7 binding. JAK1 deficient mice shows severely impaired thymic development and no hematopoietic colony formation in response to IL-7. IL-7 would first bind to IL-7RÎ± and then associates with the gamma chain, bringing their intracellular domains bearing JAK1 and JAK3 together. JAK3 phosphorylates IL-7RÎ± chain creating docking sites for the transcription factors, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate these STAT molecules and induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they activate specific target genes. PTK2B, a protein tyrosine kinase has been shown to be associated with JAK1 and plays an important role in the survival of thymocyte cell line. The enzymatic activity and its phosphorylation are highly induced by IL-7. PI-3 kinase pathway is also activated by IL-7 and this pathway is essential for the survival and proliferation of human T cell precursors. PI-3 kinase interacts with IL-7RÎ± upon IL-7 stimulation and activates its downstream target, AKT and its activation is mediated by Î³c. AKT in turn activates GSK3 beta and Bad, the death protein. Survival of pro T-cell survival by regulating Bad via PI3 kinase/AKT pathway is mediated by IL-7. IL-7 also mediates the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B through the PI-3 kinase pathway and this effect is required for cell proliferation. IL-7 also induces the phosphorylation of a Src kinase family member, Fyn which is constitutively associated with IL7RA. In addition, IL-7 induces phosphorylation of MAPK family members including MAPK1 and MAPK3.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_7_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Melanoma	Melanoma, or malignant melanoma, is a highly aggressive cancer that develops in melanocytes. Many genes have been found to be mutated or amplified in melanoma, with the most commonly mutated genes being BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53. MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling are central to melanoma. This pathway is a summary of information from figures 1 and 2 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520749/ Kunz and Vera] and supplemented with information from [https://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa05218 KEGG]. CDKN2A is frequently mutated in melanoma and germline mutations are associated with an increased susceptibility of developing skin cancer. The CDKN2A encodes two proteins, p16 (INK4A) and p14ARF, with different functions. p16 binds to CDK4, which prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby controlling the G1 to S transition. Without functioning p16, G1 to S transition can proceed. p14ARF is central to cell cycle regulation, inhibiting MDM2, which normally degrades p53, so loss of p14ARF has a similar effect to loss of p53.

Codeine and Morphine Metabolism	The principal pathways for metabolism of codeine occur in the liver, although some metabolism occurs in the intestine and brain. Approximately 50-70% of codeine is converted to codeine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine-6-glucuronide has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu opioid receptor, coded for by the OPRM1 gene. Approximately 10-15% of codeine is N-demethylated to norcodeine by CYP3A4. Norcodeine also has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu opioid receptor. Between 0-15% of codeine is O-demethylated to morphine, the most active metabolite, which has 200 fold greater affinity for the mu opioid receptor compared to codeine. This metabolic reaction is performed by CYP2D6.Approximately 60% of morphine is glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) while 5-10% is glucuronidated to morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). These reactions are principally catalyzed by UGT2B7 in the liver. UGT1A1 may have a minor role in the formation of M3G , and UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 are capable of catalyzing the formation of M6G in vitro and so contribute to this pathway, although UGT1A8 is minimally expressed in liver and so is not depicted here. M6G has a higher affinity for OPRM1 than morphine and M3G and so the ratio of morphine to M6G is considered an important indicator of analgesic effect.Transporters are also depicted in this pathway, as they influence clearance of codeine, morphine and their metabolites. Some of the evidence for the involvement of these transporters was derived from experiments done in mice and may or may not be translatable to human pharmacokinetics. The transporters present at the blood-brain barrier, not depicted in this pathway, as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters in the brain and GI tract, likely also play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of codeine and morphine.A disease linked to this pathway is Gilbert syndrome (visualised in pink), which is characterized by impaired glucuronidation due to a polymorphism in the gene encoding UGT1A1.

Metabolic pathway of LDL, HDL and TG, including diseases	This pathway shows genetic disorders related to lipoprotein metabolism. Two plasmalipoproteins, LDL and HDL, and one plasma lipid, triglyceride (TG), play an important role in this pathway. Hydrophobic lipids and fat-soluble vitamins are normally transported to the site of their uptake by transporters called lipoproteins, and any deregulation of the plasma concentrations of these proteins can cause dyslipidemias. Disorders resulting from an enzyme deficiency are highlighted in pink. More details on the composition of the various lipoproteins in this pathway are visualised in [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP3601].This pathway was inspired by Chapter 43 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))	HL,PCSK9,CETP,LPL,ABCA1,LCAT,MTP,HL 
Spinal Cord Injury	This pathway provides an overview of cell types, therapeutic targets, drugs, new proposed targets and pathways implicated in spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury is a complex multistep process that involves the regulation of gene expression and signaling in motor neurons, oligodentrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes that trigger immediate immune responses lasting several weeks. Within 24 hours, chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and suppression of axonal regeneration. An increase in the expression of cell cycle genes further results in proliferation of astrocytes and microglia that leads to apoptosis and necrosis of oligodentrocytes and neurons. An example therapy is the administration of the immunosuppressant FK506, also used in transplantation to offer neuroprotection.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2431 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Focal Adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling pathway	Cell-matrix adhesions play important roles in biological processes such as cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. Focal adhesions are structures formed at the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, consisting of bundles of actin filaments anchored to trans-membrane receptors of the integrin family through a complex of multiple proteins. In addition to participating in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions also contain signaling molecules, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent on the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins and the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signaling events results in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression.

NAD+ biosynthetic pathways	NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. NAD+ levels are maintained by three independent pathways. First, the Preiss-Handler pathway uses dietary nicotinic acid and the enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) to generate NAMN, which is then transformed into NAAD by NAMN transferase (NMNAT). Three forms of this enzyme (NMNAT1, -2, and -3) have distinct subcellular localizations. The process is completed by the transformation of NAAD into NAD+ by NAD+ synthase (NADS). Second, the de novo synthesis pathway of NAD from tryptophan occurs through the kinurenine pathway (5). The first step in this pathway is the rate-limiting conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkinurenine (N-formylkin) by either IDO or TDO. Formylkinurenine is transformed into L-kinurenine (L-kin), 3-hydroxykinurenine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and finally to ACMS. This compound can spontaneously condense and rearrange into quinolinic acid, which is transformed into NAMN, at which point it converges with the Preiss-Handler pathway. ACMS can also be decarboxylated into AMS by ACMS decarboxylase (ACMSD), leading to its oxidation into acetyl-CoA via the TCA cycle. Third, the NAD+ salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide generated as a by-product of the enzymatic activities of NAD+-consuming enzymes: sirtuins, PARPs, and the cADPR synthases (CD38 and CD157). Initially, NAMPT recycles nicotinamide into NMN, which is then converted into NAD+ via the different NMNATsProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3645 CPTAC Assay Portal]	IDO1,NAPRT1,TNKS2,PARP4,SIRT3,SIRT5,BST1,SIRT6,NMNAT1,CD38,SIRT4,SIRT2,PARP1,SIRT1,QPRT,TNKS,SIRT7,NADSYN1,PARP2,TDO2,ACMSD,NAMPT

Lipid Metabolism Pathway	Lipid metabolism is the break down or storage of fats for energy; these fats are obtained from consuming food and absorbing them or they are synthesized by an animal's liver. Lipid metabolism does exist in plants, though the processes differ in some ways when compared to animals. Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing these fats. Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs when a chemical breaks down as a reaction to coming in contact with water. Since lipids (fats) are hydrophobic, hydrolysis in lipid metabolism occurs in the cytoplasm which ends up creating glycerol and fatty acids. Due to the hydrophobic nature of lipids they require special transport proteins known as lipoproteins, which are hydrophilic. Lipoproteins are categorized by their density levels. The varying densities between the types of lipoproteins are characteristic to what type of fats they transport. A number of these lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver, but not all of them originate from this organDescription source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3965 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PRKAG1,ACACA,AKT3,PNPLA2,LIPE,PRKACA,BCKDHA,PRKAG3,ACSBG1,PRKAB1,AKT2,PLIN1,PDHA1,PRKAG2,PRKAA1,ACLY,PRKAR1A,PRKAA2,PRKACG,PRKAR2B,PRKAR1B,AKT1,ACSS2,FASN,ABHD5,PRKAB2,PRKAR2A,HILPDA,PRKACB
Calcium Regulation in the Cardiac Cell	Calcium is a common signaling mechanism, as once it enters the cytoplasm it exerts allosteric regulatory affects on many enzymes and proteins. Calcium can act in signal transduction after influx resulting from activation of ion channels or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as G protein-coupled receptors. Movement of calcium ions from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment alters membrane depolarisation. This is seen in the heart, during the plateau phase of ventricular contraction. In this example, calcium acts to maintain depolarisation of the heart.Source: [[wikipedia:Calcium_signaling|Wikipedia]]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP536 CPTAC Assay Portal]	GNG5,RGS2,PRKAR2B,CHRM5,RGS5,GNAI2,PRKACB,ADCY6,GNB4,KCNJ5,STIM2,YWHAQ,RGS19,GJB5,CALM3,ADCY9,PRKCG,YWHAE,ADRA1B,GNG12,RGS4,RGS20,ADCY5,RGS7,GNAI1,GNG11,RGS18,PRKCH,GJA5,ATP1A4,CACNA1B,PRKCD,PRKAR1A,ARRB1,PRKD1,Phospholamban,GJA8,PLN,ITPR3,CALR,CAMK4,GNAQ,GNG13,FXYD2,PRKCB1,GNB3,PRKCQ,SLC8A3,ADRB3,CAMK2A,RYR1,GJB4,ADCY4,RGS6,GRK5,PRKAR1B,CAMK2D,GJA1,CX36,YWHAZ,Calsequestrin,PRKAR2A,GNG7,GNG8,ADRA1D,GNAS,ATP1B2,CACNB1,ATP2B1,CAMK2B,ATP1B3,ADCY1,Connexin,GNGT1,RGS14,CACNA1E,GNAI3,ADCY3,ADCY8,ITPR2,PLCB3,RGS1,SLC8A1,CAMK1,GNB5,CHRM3,GJA10,ARRB2,GJB1,GNG3,CALM2,PRKCE,RYR2,RGS16,ADRB1,PRKCA,ADRA1A,GJB2,KCNB1,CHRM4,GNG2,ORAI1,CASQ2,ATP2B3,CHRM2,RGS9,PRKACA,GNAO1,ATP1B1,GNB2,CACNA1D,PKIA,PKIB,GNG4,GNAZ,CASQ1,GNA11,CHRM1,SFN,RGS11,CACNA1A,GRK6,FKBP1A,ADCY7,YWHAH,CACNB3,ITPR1,GJA12,PRKCZ,GJA4,ATP2A2,CALM1,KCNJ3,PKIG,ATP2B2,ANXA6,RYR3,GJA3,RGS10,GJB3,ADCY2,CACNA1S,Calreticulin,ADRB2,GNB1,GJB6,YWHAB,CACNA1C,CAMK2G,GJA7,YWHAG,GRK4,RGS3,RGS17,ATP2A3

p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway	p38 MAPKs are members of the MAPK family that are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. Stress signals are delivered to this cascade by members of small GTPases of the Rho family (Rac, Rho, Cdc42). As with other MAPK cascades, the membrane-proximal component is a MAPKKK, typically a MEKK or a mixed lineage kinase (MLK). The MAPKKK phosphorylates and activated MKK3/5, the p38 MAPK kinase. MKK3/6 can also be activated directly by ASK1, which is stimulated by apoptotic stimuli. P38 MAK is involved in regulation of Hsp27 and MAPKAP-2 and several transcription factors including ATF2, STAT1, THE Max/Myc complex, MEF-2, ELK-1 and indirectly CREB via activation of MSK1.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP400 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Canonical  and Non-canonical Notch signaling	This pathway is based on figure 1 of "Alteration of Notch signaling in skeletal development and disease" (see bibliography). In the NOTCH signaling pathway, mammals have 11 ligands (JAG, DLL, DLK, etc.) and 4 NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1,2,3,4). The pathway is activated by the interaction between a ligand in a ligand expressing cell and a NOTCH receptor in an adjacent, receptor expressing cell.  At this point, proteases (ADAM10 and PSEN1/2) cleave the intracellular domain (NICD) of the NOTCH protein from the extracellular domain (NECD). In the canonical pathway, NICD travels into the nucleus where it forms a transcription complex with other proteins (RBPJ and MAML1,2,3). This transcriptional complex regulates the transcription of downstream canonical target genes, such as HES1 and HEY1. In the non-canonical pathway, otherwise known as RBPJ-independent NOTCH signaling, NOTCH can activate through R-Ras to promote cell adhesion. Alternatively, NOTCH may interact with IKKa in the NF-kB pathway, or LEF1 in the Wnt pathway.While the role that the canonical NOTCH pathway plays in skeletal biology is well understood, our understanding of the role of the non-canonical pathway remains primitive.

Additionally, bacterial infection stimulates an immune response. Bacterial infection can activate macrophages and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-1. Both tissue damage and bacterial infection can induce complement activation, either via the alternative or classical pathway. Leukocytes can be attracted via pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by mast cells and activated macrophages. Leukocytes can also induce complement activation.  The combined response can result in a more permeable endothelium of blood vessels, induce swelling and activate immune cells.

BDNF-TrkB Signaling	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important neurotrophin for the regulation of synaptic activity. BDNF-TrkB signaling, TrkB being the receptor of BDNF, is involved in transcription, translation, and trafficking of proteins in the various stages of synaptic development and evidence indicates that it also plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time. Synaptic plasticity has been associated with learning and memory development. These functions are carried out through three pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase CG (PLC/PLCG), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Pi3K and MAPK have crucial roles in the protein translation and transport caused by synaptic activity. PLCG regulates intracellular levels of Ca2+, which drives gene transcription through cyclic AMP. Evidence strongly indicates that abnormal levels of BDNF leads to significant developmental and neurodegenerative diseases by disrupting neural development and function. An understanding of how the BDNF-TrkB pathway regulates synaptic activity and plasticity is essential to an understanding of how we can effectively treat genetic disruptions of this pathway that lead to terrible neurodevelopmental diseases.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3676 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MEK,PSD95,NMDAR,RHEB,TrkB,PKC,AKT,Adenyl Cyclase&#10;,Mnk1,TRPC6,TSC1,CamMKIII,TRPC3,HRAS,MAPK/Erk,GAB1,HOMER,GRB2,4E-BP1,PI3K&#10;,NRAS,BDNF,TSC2,ARC,BRAF,PLCG,p70S6,KRAS,GAB2,Rsk,CREB,MTOR,SHC,SOS
Alpha 6 Beta 4 signaling pathway	The integrin alpha6beta4 was discovered in the late 1980s by two different groups and was called either alphaEbeta4 or Ic-Ic binding protein (Ic-IcBP) (1,2). The alpha6beta4 integrin is a component of Hemidesmosomes (HDs) (3, 4,5). Increased expression of alphaEbeta4 and changes in its distribution is found to be correlated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognosis (6, 7). Although integrin alpha6beta4, can interact with different laminin isoforms, its preferred ligand in the epidermal BM is laminin-5 (8, 9). The beta4 integrin is a large protein and has a cytoplasmic domain of more than 1000 amino acids (10, 11). This domain contains a Na-Ca exchanger (CalX) motif followed by two pairs of type III fibronectin (FNIII) domains separated by a connecting segment (CS). It is found to associate with the intermediate filament system through plectin and BP230, which are components of hemidesmosomes (12,13,14). Interaction of intgrin beta4 with components of hemidesmosomes including plectin, BP230 and BP180 is found to be important in signaling events associated with cell growth, survival, and migration under physiological and pathological conditions.Studies have shown that beta4 can regulate keratinocyte migration both positively and negatively (15,16,17,18). It is also found to regulate cell survival in keratinocytes in cell culture systems under stress in a PI3K/Akt pathway dependent manner (19,18). However, alpha6beta4 was not found to have any effect on keratinocyte survival in vivo (20, 18, 16). Apart from its effects on keratinocytes, evidence suggests that integrin alpha6beta4 is important in cancer cell invasion (21,22,23,24) and survival (25,26,27,28,16,29). The cancer cell invasion is regulated through a IRS/PI3K dependent process while the effect on carcinoma cell survival in a PI3K/Akt and dependent manner. Activation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and NF-IL6 in a p38Mapk dependent pathway and subsequent activation of IL6 gene expression was shown to be mechanism of alpha6beta4 induced survival of thymocytes and proliferation of thymic epithelial cells (27,30). Integrin alpha6beta4 is also known activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which is found to be involved in the regulation of cell cycle (31,32,33,34)NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project between PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and the Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).

Gastrin Signaling Pathway	Gastrin is a peptide hormone which is involved in the process of gastric acid secretion. Gastrin release is induced by the gastrin-releasing peptide, a neurotransmitter acting on its basolateral receptor in G-cells. Gastrin is then translocated to the oxyntic mucosa in an endocrine manner where it binds to its receptor CCKBR in parietal and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. This interaction stimulates secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells and release of histamine by ECL cells. Histamine reaches parietal cells through paracrine diffusion where it binds H2 receptors and induces gastric acid secretion. Gastrin has been reported to stimulate proliferation of gastric mucosal cells,maturation of parietal cells and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and promote islet differentiation in the pancreas. Gastrin is also known to stimulate the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Produced as preprogastrin of 101 amino acids by the human G-cells of the antrum of stomach, it is sequentially cleaved to first yield progastrin and then 35-amino acid gastrin-34-Gly or an 18-amino acid gastrin-17-Gly that are often amidated.CCKAR and CCKBR cholecystokinin receptors belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, are the best characterized receptors of Gastrin. CCKBR has high affinity for gastrin and their carboxyl amidated analogues, while the CCKAR has been reported to have negligible affinity. Gq-alpha had been the major identified G-alpha subunit involved in gastrin signaling. Gastrin induces the activation of Gq-alpha and regulates the levels of IP3 and DAG through PLC-gamma1 mediated hydrolysis of PIP2. SRC has also been shown to be involved in this regulation. SRC kinase is also involved in the activation of classical RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways through IRS1-mediated recruitment of GRB2/SHC1/SOS complex and regulatory subunits of PI3Ks, respectively. PI3K pathway activation by SRC also involves the formation of SRC-FAK complexes. Gastrin induced MEK/ERK pathway is also reported to be mediated through PKCs. Gastrins have also been reported to regulate the activation of Rho, Rac and Cdc42 pathways. Recently, Liu and Jose 2013 have reported the regulation of MTOR and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 activities through a PI3K/PKC-dependent but AKT-independent pathway. Both p38MAPK and JNKs are also reported to be involved in gastrin signaling. PKAs as well as PKCs are involved in the regulation of p38MAPK activation whereas JNK activation has been shown to be mediated by MAP3K11 (MLK3). Gastrin induces the activation of eNOS and thereby nitric oxide production in ERK1/2, AKT, and p38MAPK dependent manner. Another major pathway involved in gastrin induced cell proliferation and migration is the beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway. JAK-STAT pathway has also been shown to be involved in gastrin signaling. Interestingly, JAK2 activation has been identified to be also involved in activation of PI3K pathway.Apart from CCKAR and CCKBR, recently gastrin has also been shown to bind to Annexin A2 to mediate their effects. Thus far, gastrin induced activation of NFKBs, ERKs and p38MAPK have been reported to be mediated by both CCK receptor(s) as well as Annexin A2 in multiple cells/cell typesVisit: http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Gastrin_pathway.html	CLDN1,FOS,MEF2C,SLC9A3,PRKCA,ITGB1,CD44,TCF4,ROCK1,RPS6,PRKACA,PTGS2,PRKD2,KRAS,BIRC3,PIK3R1,GSK3B,VEGFA,PIK3CA,CDC42,PTPN11,CDKN1B,EIF4EBP1,NFKB1,PRKCH,JAG1,PLCG1,RELA,PIK3R2,SP1,CTNNB1,BMP2,RHOB,MAP2K1,LAMTOR3,KIT,RHOA,PAK1,ANXA2,ARHGEF28,CCKBR,AKT1,IL8,BIRC5,RAF1,FOXO1,CREB1,YES1,SOS1,MAPK1,MMP7,PIK3R3,CDKN2A,TJP1,HRAS,PRKCE,IRS1,IKBKB,MAPK3,ARRB2,CCND1,GRB2,MAPK9,ELK1,KLF4,MYC,PPARG,GAST,FYN,JAK2,ATF2,BCAR1,SHC1,CDH1,CHUK,RHOD,CASP3,SERPINB2,FOXO3,EGR1,BIRC2,MAP3K11,NOS3,STAT3,PRKD1,EGFR,PXN,TFF2,NFKBIA,ARRB1,MAPK8,JUN,PRKCD,MEF2D,RAC1,SLC9A1,SERPINE1,GNAQ,IL2,SRC,CDKN1A,RPS6KB1,MEF2B,PTK2,BCL2L1,CRK,HDAC7,MAPK14,BAD,HDC,PRKCQ,CHGA,KAT5
Resistin as a regulator of inflammation	Resistin induced intracellular signaling pathways. No receptor for resistin has yet been identified. Resistin induces NF-kB activity. Resistin increases the cytosolic Ca concentration via both PLC activation, leading to the release of Ca from intracellular pools, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca influx from the extracellular environment. Activation of the abovementioned signaling pathways via resistin suggests that it has proinflammatory potential.

Nicotine Metabolism	Nicotine results in many metabolites after metabolization in the liver.Nicotine is the main factor behind smoking addiction, therefore nicotine supplements can be used to stop smoking. Nicotine is metabolized by several enzymes in the liver such as the CYP2A6 enzymeCYP2A6 is a xenobiotic (xenos = foreigner, bios = life) metabolizer. How well nicotine can be metabolized by the human body is not standard and depends on racial, gender, genetic and environmental factors. The cotinine metabolite seen above in the center of the nicotine metabolism pathway is a smoking biomarker and can been measured in various tissues such as blood, urine and sweat.

15q13.3 copy number variation syndrome	This pathway shows the genes deleted or duplicated in 15q13.3 copy number variation syndrome. The affected region is between 30,500,000-32,500,000 bp on Chromosome 15. The major genes in this region are OTUD7A and CHRNA7 which are known influencers of neuronal development and function. For several genes in this regio there are no exact functions known yet - e.g. the GOLGA gene group or the MTMR10 which is similar to phosphatidyl-inositol 3 phosphatases but without an active catalytic centre.

IL-4 Signaling Pathway	IL-4 is a glycoprotein which is composed of 129 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 20kDa. IL-4 and IL-13 are produced by CD4+ cells and exhibit significant functional overlap. Both these cytokines play a critical role in the promotion of allergic responses. IL-4 is primarily involved in promoting the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Apart from its role in allergic responses including asthma, IL-4 was also found to regulate retinal progenitor proliferation, rod photoreceptor differentiation, cholinergic and GABAergic amacrine differentiation and neuroprotection and survival. IL-4 was also found to have regulatory effects in a number of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephelitis. It was also found to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. IL-4 is capable of exerting its biological activities through interaction with two cell surface receptor complexes - Type I IL4 receptor and Type II IL4 Receptor. Both these receptor complexes comprise of a common IL4RÎ± (CD124) subunit, which is also the functional receptor chain. Type I IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL4RÎ± subunit with IL-2Î³c (CD132). Type II IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL-4RÎ± subunit with IL-13RÎ±. Interaction of IL-4 with its receptor results in receptor dimerization and activation. The Type I receptors activates JAK1 and 3, which are associated with the receptor subunits. The activated JAK phosphorylates tyrosine residues the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor which then serves as docking sites for a number of adaptor or signaling molecules including STAT6. Activated STAT6 dimerizes, translocated to the nucleus and transcriptionally actives genes responsive to IL-4. Many of the key functions of IL4 allergic disorders, including TH2 cell differentiation, airway hyper responsiveness, mucus cell metaplasia and IgE synthesis are dependent on STAT6 activation. Other phosphorylated tyrosine residue bind to proteins with phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) motifs including IRS proteins. This results in the phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, which can then potentially activate the PI3K/AKT cascade by binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K or the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thought to mediate the growth and survival signals in multiple IL-4 responsive cell types including T- and B- lymphocytes and natural killer cellsPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_4_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Neuroinflammation	Neuroinflammation is inflammation specific to parts of the central nervous system. It can be triggered by external or internal factors, such as UV damage, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Stress on the cell leads to activation of inflammatory response pathways that involve several transcription factors such as AP-1 and NFkB, which will lead to the transcription of several proteins and/or cytokines.

Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Netpath	The Aryl Hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is ligand activated transcription factor that regulates wide spectrum of gene expression. The main mediator of AhR is 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are widespread environmental pollutant causing a variety of severe health effects, e.g. immunosuppression, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. AhR is a member of basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) superfamily of transcription factors. In the absence of ligand, the AhR can be found in the cytosol, bound to a dimer of the heat shock protein of 90 kDa (Hsp90) and the immunophilin-like protein, AIP (also known as XAP2 and ARA9). Upon ligand binding, the AHR translocates to the nucleus and binds with ARNT. The AHR/ARNT heterodimer binds to xenobiotic response elements and regulates a diverse set of genes.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2586 CPTAC Assay Portal]	KLF6,NRAS,Nrf2,Rb,EGFR,COX-2,MAP2K1,CYP1B1,Rel A,p21cip1,CD36,ARNT,VEGF,E2F1,CYP1A1,HRAS,p50,SRC-1,CYP1A2,TNF-ÃŽÂ±,HSP90,CDK2,P23,KRAS,AHR,RAF1,AHRR,AIP,CCL1,CDC37,p27Kip1
Neurotransmitter Disorders	Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers which mediate, amplify, or modulate synaptic transmissions between neurons, meaning that many are involved in primary brain functions such as movement, pain threshold, memory, and so on. The are various disorders associated with neurotransmitter dysfunction, which may also be caused by defects in the neurotransmitter transporters. This pathway describes various defects including deficiencies of tyrosine hydrolyse (TH), aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH), monoamine oxidase A, as well as the heredity dopamine transporter syndrome and the brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transporter (VMAT2) disease. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 31 (neurotransmitter Disorders) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).

Interaction between Notch pathway components. Dll1 activates Notch1 signaling producing N1ICD, and Dll3 inhibits Notch1 signaling. N1ICD activates transcription of Mesp2, Lfng and Hes7. Hes7 protein inhibits its own transcription and that of Lfng. The effect of Lfng on Notch1 signaling is contradictory; it can potentiate Notch1 signaling in cultured mammalian cells, and inhibit signaling in the embryo. Mesp2 protein activates the transcription of Lfng, Ripply2 and Epha4. Ripply2 inhibits the transcription of Mesp2 and Epha4 is implicated in somite border formation in zebrafish but is not required for this in mouse.Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.

Polyol Pathway	When glucose is unused, it is metabolized via the polyol pathway. This pathway consists of two main enzymatic steps. First, glucose is reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase. In this step, NADPH is oxidized to NADP+. The next step is the oxidation of sorbitol to D-fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenaseFructose can then be phosphorylated by fructokinase and subsequently be metabolized via dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which can be used as a substrate in the process of glycolysisThe sorbitol pathway plays a role in diabetic renal complications because aldose reductase metabolizes the excess of glucose to toxic metabolites that induce hyperfiltration and glomerular dysfunction.

Riboflavin and CoQ disorders	Riboflavin (aka Vitamin B2) is used as molecular precursor for the formation of FAD and FMN, which are both essential cofactors in beta-oxidation, branched-chain-amino-acid catabolism and the mitochondrial electron transport of the TCA cycle.Coenzyme Q10 (aka ubiquinone or CoQ10) functions as a electron carrier, antioxidant and influences pyrimidine metabolism directly.This pathway was inspired by Chapter 16 (ed. 4) from the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).

NRF2-ARE regulation	Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered to the cytoplasm through binding with Keap1/Cul3/RBX1 and continually degraded via the proteasome. On early response to external stressors, Keap1 is oxidized or Nrf2 is phosphorylated by PKC. Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus and binds to ARE (antioxidant-responsive) genes in order to increase or decrease transcription. A delayed response to external stressors causes phosphorylation of GSK-3β (by unknown tyrosine kinases), GSK-3β then activates Src kinases, which then translocate to the nucleus. Src kinases phosphorylate Nrf2 (Tyr568) which allows for nuclear export, ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. If insulin receptor signaling is initiated, GSK-3β activity is inhibited. Keap1 is also able to regulate Nrf2 activity through sequestration with PGAM5 to the mitochondria. In addition, PI3K also phosphorylates the CEBPB, inducing its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to the CEBPB response element within the xenobiotic response element, in conjunction with NRF2 binding to ARE.Description was adapted from Fig 1 in Vomhof-Dekrey et al, and Fig 4 in Surh et al.

Apoptosis	Apoptosis is a distinct form of cell death that is functionally and morphologically different from necrosis. Nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic shrinking, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane blebbing characterize apoptosis in general. Mitochondria remain morphologically unchanged.

SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor: molecular mechanisms	For initial entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells, the large viral Spike (S) protein needs to be primed by host proteases. For SARS-CoV-2 that is the serine protease TMPRSS2. After binding to its functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus undergoes endocytosis. After endocytosis of the viral complex, surface ACE2 is further down-regulated, resulting in unopposed angiotensin 2 accumulation. Local activation of the angiotensin pathway system may mediate lung injury responses to viral insults.ACE denotes angiotensin-converting enzyme and ARB angiotensin-receptor blocker	Soluble ACE2,ACE2,TMPRSS2,REN,AT1R,AGT,MAS1
RANKL/RANK (Receptor activator of NFKB (ligand)) Signaling Pathway	RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), RANK (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) and the natural decoy receptor of RANKL, OPG (Osteoprotegerin) are three important molecules identified to play a major role in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodelling. They are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. OPG was the first molecule to be discovered and proved to inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike other members of TNF family, OPG lack a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein by the cell. RANKL is the only known physiological agonist for its receptor, RANK. Genetic experiments have shown that mice lacking either rankl or rank suffer from severe osteoporosis and defective tooth eruption due to complete lack of osteoclasts. On the contrary, mice deficient of OPG shows osteoporosis due to increased number of osteoclasts. Binding of RANKL to RANK triggers downstream signaling events that leads to the activation of osteoclasts and controlling of lineage commitment. RANKL/RANK signaling is essential for skeletal homoeostasis and its interference leads to inhibition of bone resorption resulting in bone diseases including osteoporosis osteopetrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. RANK being a member of TNF family does not possess any kinase activity. It recruits adaptor molecules to transduce the signal after ligand binding. These adaptor molecules are called TNFR-associated factors or TRAF's that binds to different regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the TNF family receptors and transduces the signal downstream. TRAF6 is the main adaptor molecule which activates NF-κB pathway downstream of RANKL signaling which is required for osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. TRAF6 mutant mice have shown a partial block in osteoclastogenesis and defective activation of mature osteoclasts. Mice lacking NF-κB p50 and p52 proteins have been shown to be osteopetrotic. Catalytic subunits, IκB kinase α and IκB kinase β and the non-catalytic subunit IKKγ (also called NEMO) are also essential for RANKL-RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis. IKKγ is required for osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL in mice both in vivo and in vitro whereas IKKα was shown to be required in mice only in in vitro. Several mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK's) have been shown to be activated downstream of RANK. Studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK's blocked RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation. JNK1/2, its upstream kinase MKK7 and c-Jun have also been shown by genetic experiments to be essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. MAPK1 and MAPK3 phosphorylation was also shown to be dispensable for RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in vitro, but another report also show that specific inhibitors to MEK increased RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis suggesting a cross talk between p38 and ERK signaling pathways. NFATc1 is an essential downstream target of RANK. Ca2+ oscillations induced by RANKL activated NFATc1 resulting in terminal differentiation of osteoclasts through the Ca2+- dependent calcineurin pathway. NFATc1 translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors leading to the activation of transcription of genes including ACP5, CTSK, TNFRSF11A and NFATc1 under RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 and c-Src interacts with each other and with RANK upon stimulation with RANKL. This interaction increases the kinase activity of c-Src leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as c-Cbl and activation of Akt/PKB which in turn requires the PI3-Kinase activity. Genetic experiments have shown that c-Src is very important in osteoclastogenesis. In addition to these pathways, aPKC/p62 signaling is also reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis. Apart from their role in osteoclast differentiation and function, RANKL-RANK signaling is also required for development of lymph node and lactating mammary glands in mice and in the establishment of thymic microenvironment.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/rankl_pathway.html NetSlim] databaseIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper: Raju, R., Balakrishnan, L., Nanjappa, V., Bhattacharjee, M., Getnet, D., Muthusamy, B., Thomas, J.

mBDNF and proBDNF regulation of GABA neurotransmission	This pathway depicts the regulation of GABA receptor surface expression of BDNF signaling.BDNF can be secreted in both a mature form (mBDNF) and a precursor form (proBDNF), both of which modulate GABA synaptic transmission in neurons. mBDNF activates TrkB receptors leading to an inhibition of GABAAR endocytosis and a consequent increase in cell surface expression of these receptors through the PI 3-kinase and the PKC signaling pathway. In addition, BDNF/TrkB signaling regulates GABAAR and KCC2 at the transcriptional level through the Shc, PLCg and MAP/ERK pathways.proBDNF activates NGFR, which decreases GABAARs cell surface expression through the RhoA/ROCK/PTEN pathway, through dephosphorylation of GABAAR followed by endocytosis and degradation of internalized receptors. proBNDF/NGFR signaling also leads to the transcriptional repression of GABAAR synthesis through JAK2/STAT3/CREM. The proBDNF/NGFR signaling also decreases KCC2 expressionThis pathway is based on figure 1 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121065/ Porcher et al]	GABRA6,GABRB1,NTRK2,CREB1,CREM,PIK3R3,GABRA2,AP2A1,GABRB3,GABRE,GABRG1,GABRA3,PIK3R2,GABRQ,STAT3,RHOA,mBDNF,GABRP,PKC,GABRA4,SLC12A5,PIK3R1,PIK3CA,GABRA1,GABRA5,AP2A2,PLCG1,GABRD,GABRB2,proBDNF,NGFR,JAK2,PIK3CB,PIK3CG,AP2B1,GABRG2,GABRG3,ROCK1,PTEN,SHC1
Wnt Signaling	Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04310.html KEGG].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP428 CPTAC Assay Portal]	FZD2,FZD8,PRKCB,SERPINF1,VANGL1,FZD10,CCND2,SOX17,PRKCA,NFATC1,CSNK1E,PRKCG,APC,PPP3CA,WNT2B,SFRP5,WNT3,CHD8,MAP3K7,ROR1,PPP3CB,FOSL1,NOTUM,PLAU,WNT7A,DAAM2,WIF1,FZD1,GSK3B,NFATC4,DKK2,PPP3CC,CSNK2A3,WNT16,NFATC3,DAAM1,LRP5,SOST,TCF7L1,RHOA,WNT5B,FRAT1,GPC4,SFRP2,NFATC2,CTNNB1,WNT3A,SFRP4,WNT6,WNT4,CTBP1,PLCB2,WNT10B,ROCK2,PLCB3,TCF7L2,WNT2,NLK,CTNNBIP1,AXIN1,WNT10A,PPP3R1,CAMK2D,FRAT2,PORCN,WNT11,DVL3,CSNK1A1L,PLCB4,MAPK9,MYC,CAMK2A,TCF7,CTBP2,CCND1,FZD4,SENP2,CCND3,FZD9,LEF1,CAMK2B,PLCB1,WNT1,PPP3R2,ROR2,CAMK2G,DKK1,WNT7B,DKK4,FZD5,FZD6,PRICKLE2,JUN,PRICKLE1,NKD1,RAC1,DVL1,NKD2,MAPK8,FZD7,SFRP1,FZD3,WNT5A,VANGL2,RYK,DVL2,LRP6,CER1,INVS,CSNK2A1,CSNK2A2,CXXC4,KREM1,CSNK2B,CSNK1A1,MAPK10

Heme Biosynthesis	The enzymatic process that produces heme is properly called porphyrin synthesis, as all the intermediates are tetrapyrroles that are chemically classified are porphyrins. The process is highly conserved across biology. In humans, this pathway serves almost exclusively to form heme. In other species, it also produces similar substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12).The pathway is initiated by the synthesis of D-Aminolevulinic acid (dALA or Î´ALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is strictly regulated by intracellular iron levels and heme concentration. A low-iron level, e.g., in iron deficiency, leads to decreased porphyrin synthesis, which prevents accumulation of the toxic intermediates. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin can abort attacks of porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.The organs mainly involved in heme synthesis are the liver and the bone marrow, although every cell requires heme to function properly. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of haemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism.Source: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme	PPOX,UROS,HMBS,ALAS2,ALAS1,ALAD,CPOX,FECH,UROD

Glycine Metabolism	Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved is usually called the glycine cleavage systemIn the second pathway, glycine is degraded in two steps. The first step is the reverse of glycine biosynthesis from serine with serine hydroxymethyl transferase. Serine is then converted to pyruvate by serine dehydrataseIn the third pathway of glycine degradation, glycine is converted to glyoxylate by D-amino acid oxidase. Glyoxylate is then oxidized by hepatic lactate dehydrogenase to oxalate in an NAD+-dependent reactionDescription source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine#Metabolism Wikipedia]	Glycine Transaminase,SHMT2,Glycine Oxidase,SHMT1,MTHFR

Hijack of Ubiquitination by SARS-CoV-2	SARS-CoV-2 includes a novel Orf10 that interacts with muliple members of the Cullin 2 ubiquitin ligase complex as determined by AP-MS (Gordon 2020). The strongest interaction is with ZYG11B, a substrate adaptor for CUL2. By binding this complex, Orf10 might be able to hijack its activity. The hijacking of ubiquitination machinery is a common strategy of viruses to direct the degradation of viral restriction factors, for example. Also depicted here is the required neddylation (N8) of CUL2 by the NAE enzyme complex. The ability of this enzyme to transfer N8 to CUL2 is inhibited by the small molecule Pevonedistat.

Autosomal recessive Osteopetrosis pathways	Taken from Osteopetrosis: genetics, treatment and new insights into osteoclast function by Cristina Sobacchi, Ansgar Schulz, Fraser P. Coxon, Anna Villa and Miep H. Helfrich [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877423].The osteopetroses are genetic diseases characterized by increased bone mass and density due to a failure in bone resorption. Two major forms can be distinguished on the basis of their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO, formerly known as Albers-Schönberg disease), is usually considered an adult-onset, more benign form (and has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere); whereas autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also termed malignant infantile osteopetrosis, presents soon after birth, is often severe and leads to death if left untreated.Mechanisms underlying osteoclast-‑rich ARO:Ruffled border formation and bone resorption by osteoclasts are dependent on secretory lysosome trafficking. Genes implicated in osteoclast-‑rich autosomal recessive osteopetrosis encode proteins that localize to secretory lysosomes in osteoclasts. TCIRG1 encodes the a3 subunit of the V0 complex, part of the V‑ATPase proton pump that acidifies endosomes and lysosomes; CLCN7 encodes ClC‑7, the Cl– antiporter responsible for increasing lumenal Cl– concentration; OSTM1 encodes the β‑subunit of CIC‑7; PLEKHM1 encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the active (GTP-‑bound) form of Rab7, which is associated with late endosomes and lysosomes; and SNX10 encodes sorting nexin 10, which localizes to endosomes via a phosphoinositide-‑binding PX domain. This domain also interacts with the V1 complex D subunit of V‑ATPase, raising the possibility that SNX10 is involved in trafficking of V‑ATPase. ARO-‑causing mutations in all five genes disrupt trafficking of secretory lysosomes, thereby impairing ruffled-‑border formation and bone resorption. Osteoclast formation and adhesion to bone through the sealing zone are unaffected.Mechanisms underlying osteoclast-‑poor ARO:Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on the RANK signalling pathway. In normal osteoclasts, binding of RANKL recruits TRAF6, which releases NFκB from its phosphorylated inhibitor IκB. NFκB translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of key osteoclast genes. Osteopetrosis-‑causing mutations in TNFRSF11A (which encodes RANK) either reduce protein expression at the plasma membrane  or impair RANKL binding, which leads to the loss of NFκB signalling and prevents differentiation and fusion of osteoclast precursors. Similarly, osteoclast differentiation defects are seen if osteopetrosis-‑causing mutations in TNFSF11 (which encodes RANKL) are present. Mutations identified so far lead to reduced RANKL trimerization or impaired RANK binding. Osteoclast formation studies in vitro reveal these two distinct osteoclast-‑poor forms of ARO: those in which osteoclastogenesis cannot be induced by synthetic RANKL (TNFRSF11A-‑related ARO) and those in which osteoclastogenesis can be induced by synthetic RANKL, resulting in osteoclasts that function normally (TNFSF11-‑related ARO). Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.	IKBKB,CLCN7,NFKB1,TNFRSF11A,PLEKHM1,OSTM1,TNFSF11,TCIRG1,TRAF6,SNX10,RAB7A

Notch Signaling Pathway Netpath	The Notch pathway is an evolutionally conserved signaling pathway which plays an important role in diverse developmental and physiological processes. These include cell-fate determination, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death. The Notch pathway is named after the Drosophila mutants that showed irregular notches of missing tissue at the insect wing blade tips. The Notch gene was cloned in 1985. Proteins of the Notch families are single-pass transmembrane proteins that function both as cell surface receptors and nuclear transcriptional regulators. Four Notch receptors (Notch 1-4) have been identified in mammals. Mature Notch receptors are non-covalent heterodimers consisting of an extracellular subunit (NEC) and a transmembrane subunit (NTM). NEC possess multiple EGF-like repeats and three specialized Lin-Notch repeats (LNR) that forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with extracellular stump of NTM. This region masks an A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) cleavage site. The region where these two subunits interact is called the heterodimerization domain (HD). Notch ligands are also transmembrane proteins with multiple EGF-like repeats, a short cytoplasmic tail and a specialized delta-serrate-lag2 (DSL) domain at the N-terminus. There are five canonical Notch ligands i.e. Jagged (JAG1 and JAG2), Delta-like (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) in mammals. Notch signaling activation occurs upon ligand-receptor binding, which are expressed on two adjacent cells. Ligand binding causes dissociation of NEC from NTM, unmasking the ADAM cleavage site. The NEC fragment is trans- endocytosed into the ligand expressing cells. The full-length receptor minus the NEC fragment is cleaved at the membrane by ADAM17 generating an intermediate, Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). This is further cleaved by Î³-secretase that generates an active Notch intracellular fragment (NIC) or Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The Î³-secretase complex is composed of PSEN1, PSEN2, PSENEN, NCSTN and APH1 (A or B). Following these two cleavage steps, the NICD is released into the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription of Notch target genes. Upon translocation into the nucleus, NICD binds to RBPJ which is a constitutive repressor of Notch signaling. RBPJ represses Notch target gene expression by recruiting a co-repressor complex, which includes NCOR1, NCOR2, SNW1, CIR, HDAC1, HDAC2, SPEN and FHL1 and SAP30. NICD binding to RBPJ replaces the co-repressor complex with a co-activator complex which includes MAML1-3, EP300 and SNW1. Primary Notch target genes include two families of transcriptional factors Hes, including HES1 and HES5 as well as Hey including HEY1 and HEY2. Other Notch target genes include CCND1, CDKN1A, GATA3 and PTCRA. CNTN1 acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction causes Î³-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the NICD. This signaling is involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulation of myelin-related protein MAG. In addition to the canonical Notch pathway, there is increasing evidence showing RBPJ independent non-canonical pathways. been fully characterized. Physical interaction of NOTCH-1IC with LCK- PI3K may mediate non-nuclear cross-talk with AKT, leading to survival signaling. Notch stimulation through AKT pathway leads to down regulation of MYC expression. Activation of SRC/STAT3 pathway by Notch signaling is dependent on the expression of Notch effector HES1 transcription factor. The induction of HES1 enhanced SRC phosphorylation. This activated SRC kinase was found to be responsible for the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3. The HES1 and HES5 proteins associate with and facilitate the complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, thus promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. The activated STAT3 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces transcriptional activation of target gene expression (including HIF1A).Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/notch_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Once active, Akt controls a number of downstream cellular processes, including apoptosis, protein synthesis, metabolism, and cell cycle, by phosphorylating a range of substrates.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4172 CPTAC Assay Portal]	GNG5,FASLG,NTF4,PPP2R3C,CREB5,NTRK1,COL4A5,HSP90AB1,CREB3L1,NTRK2,VEGFC,ITGA1,GNB4,IRS1,TNC,IGF2,PHLPP1,CREB3,PPP2R5B,COL9A1,HRAS,TLR4,PHLPP2,ITGAV,CASP9,EIF4E1B,PRKAA2,TCL1B,IFNB1,TSC2,CCND2,THBS1,TLR2,HSP90AA1,GNG11,ITGA7,PPP2CA,GYS1,PDGFB,VEGFD,ANGPT1,PDGFD,FGF1,OSM,TGFA,VTN,LAMC1,IL2,IFNA1,FGF20,ITGB5,FGFR2,BCL2L1,FLT3LG,TSC1,COL6A1,GNB3,CSF1,SGK2,PPP2R5E,PKN2,LPAR2,COL6A3,BAD,PIK3CB,IFNAR1,CCND1,OSMR,PPP2R2C,TNR,PTEN,CDK4,PPP2R5A,EIF4E2,IFNA13,BCR,IFNAR2,PIK3CG,CSF1R,FGF19,FGF8,FGF9,ITGA2,PIK3R5,RBL2,JAK3,MTOR,COMP,F2R,COL9A3,RELA,PIK3R2,RHEB,LAMB4,VEGFB,IFNA21,ITGA10,COL6A6,THBS3,KITLG,AKT3,CDK6,PPP2R3A,EGF,IL3,RAF1,FLT1,LAMA2,PDGFC,FLT4,TP53,MAPK1,VWF,PIK3R3,ITGB1,PCK2,CREB3L4,EPOR,HSP90B1,GNG2,C8orf44-SGK3,FGF17,RPS6,PIK3CA,FGF4,THEM4,STK11,CHRM2,EIF4EBP1,ITGA11,GNB2,LAMA5,FGFR4,PRKAA1,LPAR6,FGF6,FGF14,IFNA2,ATF6B,FGF10,CSF3R,IFNA10,CDK2,BRCA1,COL2A1,GYS2,IL4R,MLST8,COL4A4,MYC,PIK3CD,GH1,JAK2,KDR,PPP2R5C,FGF3,EFNA5,GRB2,PPP2R3B,ANGPT2,EIF4E,ITGB3,FLT3,PPP2CB,PGF,COL6A5,GHR,PPP2R1B,CSH1,LPAR3,KIT,MDM2,EPHA2,COL1A2,MYB,LAMB3,Mtcp1,AKT1,LPAR5,LAMA3,ITGA2B,IL2RG,ATF4,CD19,PPP2R2A,PIK3AP1,IFNA6,FGF2,LAMB1,COL4A3,GNG12,IFNA8,MCL1,LAMA1,HGF,PCK1,KRAS,ITGB8,BCL2L11,NFKB1,LAMB2,PKN1,CSH2,FGF12,EFNA2,COL4A2,PDGFRB,RAC1,IL7,EGFR,RPS6KB2,GNG13,PTK2,PPP2R2B,CDKN1A,RPS6KB1,FGF18,COL9A2,SYK,IL2RA,PPP2R2D,CCNE1,INSR,LAMC2,TCL1A,NGFR,THBS2,RELN,G6PC3,GNG7,JAK1,BCL2,LAMC3,PDGFA,GNG8,NOS3,PRLR,MAP2K2,IL4,IFNA17,GH2,FGF7,MAP2K1,GNGT1,FN1,IL6,RPTOR,IFNA14,ITGA4,CREB1,INS,CDC37,IGF1R,TNXB,IKBKG,SOS1,FGF5,PDGFRA,IL2RB,IFNA7,SGK3,GNB5,PPP2R5D,FGF22,FGFR1,IKBKB,MET,MAPK3,GNG3,ITGA3,PRKCA,G6PC2,THBS4,IL7R,COL6A2,ITGA8,Kik1b4,IL3RA,IFNA16,VEGFA,CREB3L3,PKN3,ITGB4,SOS2,ITGB7,PIK3R6,FGF11,TEK,PIK3R1,PPP2R1A,GSK3B,AKT2,EFNA1,LPAR1,GNGT2,GNG4,CDKN1B,CHAD,SGK1,FGFR3,CHRM1,PDPK1,COL1A1,EFNA4,EFNA3,G6PC,CREB3L2,FGF23,GNG10,IL6R,ANGPT4,IBSP,COL4A6,IFNA4,NTF3,NGF,ITGA5,SPP1,COL4A1,ITGB6,EPO,EIF4B,NRAS,CHUK,ATF2,BDNF,ITGA6,IGF1,FGF21,GNB1,TNN,IFNA5,CSF3,LPAR4,CCND3,LAMA4,DDIT4,PRL,CCNE2,ITGA9,FGF13,FOXO3
Regulation of Microtubule Cytoskeleton	Microtubules (MTs) are essential for vesicle transport, cellular polarity and the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. MTs are dynamic, undergoing assembly and depolymerization (primarily at the "plus end") by processes actively regulated by signaling pathways. The tubulin dimers that constitute MTs (depicted in green) are bound and sequestered by stathmin (STMN), enhancing MT dynamics by increasing rapid depolymerization (a.k.a., "MT catastrophe"). MT dynamics are also enhanced by collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP2), which increases MT growth by promoting the addition of tubulin dimers onto microtubule plus ends. Other proteins that associate with assembled MTs include those that stabilize MTs (e.g. tau or MAPT), those that promote assembly (e.g., XMAP215), and those that maintain MTs in a dynamic state (e.g., MAP1B). Complexes between the adenomateous polyposis coli (APC) protein and plus end binding proteins (e.g., EB1) stabilize MTs by increasing the duration of the MT elongation phase. MT instability is promoted by several nonmotile kinesins from the kinesin-13 family, e.g., the mitotic centromere associated kinesin, MCAK, by accelerating the transition to catastrophe by weakening the lateral interactions between the protofilaments. Upstream from these processes, major signaling pathways act to regulate MT dynamics, e.g., those converging on GSK3B, a kinase which targets tau and CRMP2Reference: https://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science-pathway-research-cytoskeletal/regulation-of-microtubule-dynamics-signaling-pathway/pathways-microProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2038 CPTAC Assay Portal]	mDIA1,RhoGEF,AKT,GNAQ ,ICIS,CDK1,TPPP,LPR,TAOK,TIAM1,MARK,STAT3,RAC1,EB1,MAPKAPK,CAMK,TESK,WNT,ROCK,LL5b,PKC,Rho,MCAK,SRC,PAR6,TRIO,GSK3B,PIK3,MAP1B,PRKACA,CDC42,mDIA,PAR3,CLIP,PAR1,LIMK,XMAP215,STMN,APC,MARK2,CRMP2,AURKB,CLASP,ERK,SPRED1,CFL,c-ABL,TAU,DVL,PAK,PTEN

Type II diabetes mellitus	Insulin resistance is strongly associated with type II diabetes. "Diabetogenic" factors including FFA, TNFalpha and cellular stress induce insulin resistance through inhibition of IRS1 functions. Serine/threonine phosphorylation, interaction with SOCS, regulation of the expression, modification of the cellular localization, and degradation represent the molecular mechanisms stimulated by them. Various kinases (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process.The development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells, with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction. Although there is little doubt as to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results. Kir6.2 and IRS are two of the candidate genes. It is known that Kir6.2 and IRS play central roles in insulin secretion and insulin signal transmission, respectively.Source: [http://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map04930 KEGG]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1584 CPTAC Assay Portal].	&#9;PRKCD,GK,ERK,JNK,GLUT4,PDX-1,SURF1,GLUT2,IKK,Kir6.2,PYK,ADIPO,INSR,mTOR,IRS,SOCS,TNF alpha,VDCC,PRKCZ,P13K,MafA,INS
Inflammatory Response Pathway	Inflammation is a protective response of cells to pathogens, infection or tissue damage. It involves the coordinated communication of different immune cells and blood vessels through an intricate cascade of molecular signals. Inflammation can cause fever, cardiovascular pathology, allergy anaphylaxis, fibrosis, autoimmunity, etc.The inflammatory response has four phases: inflammatory inducers (infection or tissue damage), inflammatory sensors (mast cells and macrophages), inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, etc.) and the tissues that are affected. Each phase has many options that are triggered based on the type pathogen introduced.In addition, chronic inflammatory conditions, where an inducer is not well defined, are becoming more common. These conditions are of particular interest because they coincide with other diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

Regulation of Wnt/B-catenin Signaling by Small Molecule Compounds	The Wnt/B-catenin pathway begins with Wnt family activation by MBOAT that allows Wnt proteins to translocate out of a cell and bind to FZD and LRP to form a complex. This complex stimulates B-catenin to bind to the TF/LEF complex to regulate gene expression in the cell. Regulation of this pathway takes place at different levels. The Wnt signaling can be inhibited by DKK3, FZD7, SFRP4, FZD8, V3Nter, and Wnt antibodies or FZD antibodies that inhibit FZD and do not allow formation of FZD/LRP/Wnt complex. Another level of regulation is the destruction complex (TNKS/AXIN/GSK3B/APC/CK1a/CK1e) that is regulated by XAV939, DVL, IC261, and Pyrvinium to catalyze the breakdown of B-catenin, inhibiting its binding to the TCF/LEF complex. Several substances including retinoids, glucocorticoids, and ICG-001 inhibit the TCF/LEF complex to stop Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathways from promoting gene transcription.

Cytokines and Inflammatory Response	Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate their actions.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Susceptibility Pathways	In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics. The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm). While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population. The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301, PMID: 20124538). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987, PMID: 20124538). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority of neuronal serotonin produced and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).Genes associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association with SIDS. Principle among these genes the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH2, the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however, it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons. Another potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).In addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively common one (SP1).Finally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4, many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS. In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1 are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064). Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among the most significant risk factors for SIDS.

IL1 and megakaryocytes in obesity	Schematic of the effects of interleukin (IL)1-beta/IL1R1 on megakaryocyte and platelet function. A high fat diet will cause megakaryocytes to produce platelets with an increase in both inflammatory and thrombotic genes.IL1-beta in circulation as a result of increased body weight will bind IL1R1 on megakaryocytes. This interaction leads to the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)kB, PI3K/Akt, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (ERK and p38) pathways. As a result, there is an increase in megakarycoyte maturation, including increased adhesion, increases in ploidy, and increases in mRNA production of inflammatory and thrombotic genes. IL1-beta can also bind IL1R1 on platelets and either enhance aggregation induced by agonists or promote adhesion and heterotypic aggregate formation.Some of the data used to create the pathway was generated in mouse (noted in pathway), however the pathway represents human homologs of those genes.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2865 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PIK3CA,IFNG,TIMP1,PLA2G7,TLR2,S100A9,NFKB1,PAR1,FCER1A,TIMP2,MMP9,IL18,Thrombin,IRAK1,MYD88,HBEGF,IL1B,CCR3,IL1R1,TLR1,CCL2,SELENBP1,NLRP3,ICAM1
Control of immune tolerance by vasoactive intestinal peptide	Control of immune tolerance by VIP controls immune homeostasis.Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is released from nerve terminals (nervous source) and blood (endocrine source), or produced by T helper 2 (TH2) cells or macrophages (immune source) in response to antigenic and inflammatory stimulation. VIP induces immune tolerance and inhibits the autoimmune response through different non-excluding mechanisms. First, it induces the generation and differentiation of TH2-cell functions and decrease TH1-cell functions through direct actions on differentiating T cells, or indirectly by regulating antigen presenting cell (APC) functions. As a consequence, the inflammatory and autoimmune responses are impaired, and the anti-helminthic and atopic responses are increased, because the infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages by interferon-γ (IFNγ) and the production of complement-activating IgG2 antibodies are avoided. Second, VIP impairs the co-stimulatory activity of APCs on effector T cells, inhibiting subsequent clonal expansion. This avoids the inflammatory response and its cytotoxic effect against the target tissue. Third, VIP induces the generation of regulatory T cells that suppress the activation of autoreactive T cells by producing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). This effect contributes to the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory state and restores immune tolerance. 	CD80,IL2,CD95,VIP,TCR,IL4,IL5,MHCII,TGFB,IL12A,CD28,IL10,IL12B,CTLA4,IFNG,CD86
Glucocorticoid Receptor Pathway	The glucocorticoid receptor (GR, a.k.a. NR3C1) is a nuclear receptor that is activated upon binding of cortisol or glucocorticoids.

Regulation of toll-like receptor signaling pathway	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are conserved and specific molecular "signatures" expressed by pathogens. TLR ligation triggers distinct but shared signaling pathways that lead to effector mechanisms in innate immune responses. TLR specificity and activation are strictly and finely tuned at multiple levels of various signal transduction pathways, resulting in complex signaling platforms. Many molecules, ranging from membrane and cytosol to nuclear, contribute to TLR ligand discrimination or receptor signaling and play different roles in the regulation of TLR responses via different mechanisms, such as cross-regulation, protein modification, helper cofactors, and posttranscriptional and epigenetic regulation.

Lamin A-processing pathway	All lamins, except lamin C, contain a CaaX tail. This tail is comprised of respectively cysteine, two aliphatic amino acids and any amino acid with a COOH-terminal (variable). Aliphatic amino acids are nonpolar and hydrophobic and include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. This structure acts as recognition point for a sequence of modifications. First the terminal cysteine is farnesylated by farnesyl transferase, where a isoprenyl group is added to the cysteine residue -also called isoprenylation. This is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the aaX part by Zmpste24 and methylation (CH3) of cysteine. Isoprenylation and methylation are both necessary for the localization of lamin A and B-type lamins in to the INM. Until this point processing of lamin A and type-B lamins is similar. While in type-B lamins the isoprenyl group remains attached to the cysteine, lamin A has a second cleavage site to cleave off an additional 15 amino acids upstream of the cysteine. This cleavage is also done by Zmpste24 and takes place at INM. When these 15 amino acids, 18 in total including aaX, are cleaved off mature lamin A is produced (1,2). Lamin processing is involved in progeria.	LMNA,ZMPSTE24,Pre-lamin A
Base Excision Repair	Base excision repair is a cellular mechanism that repairs damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle. It is primarily responsible for removing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions from the genome.Base excision repair is important for removing damaged bases that could otherwise cause mutations by mispairing, or could lead to breaks in DNA during replication. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. These are then cleaved by an AP endonuclease. The resulting single-strand break can then be processed by either short-patch (where a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch BER (where 2-10 new nucleotides are synthesized). The choice between short- and long-patch repair is currently under investigation. Various factors are thought to influence this decision, including the type of lesion, the cell cycle stage, and whether the cell is terminally differentiated or actively dividing. Some lesions, such as oxidized or reduced AP sites, are resistant to pol β lyase activity and therefore must be processed by long-patch BER.This pathway is based on information from [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/4/ REPAIRtoire], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair Wikipedia] and [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map03410 KEGG].

DDX1 as a regulatory component of the Drosha microprocessor	Posttranscriptional maturation is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis that determines mature miRNA levels. In addition to core components (Drosha and DGCR8 [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8]) in the microprocessor, regulatory RNA-binding proteins may confer the specificity for recruiting and processing of individual primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Here, we identify DDX1 as a regulatory protein that promotes the expression of a subset of miRNAs, including five members in the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and four miRNAs in an eight-miRNA signature of a mesenchymal ovarian cancer subtype. A majority of DDX1-dependent miRNAs are induced after DNA damage. This induction is facilitated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated phosphorylation of DDX1. Inhibiting DDX1 promotes ovarian tumor growth and metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that low DDX1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with serous ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that DDX1 is a key modulator in miRNA maturation and ovarian tumor suppression.This pathway is based on the graphical abstract from http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00660-3.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2942 CPTAC Assay Portal]	NBN,DROSHA,MRE11A,ATM,DGCR8,DDX1,RAD50
Complement and Coagulation Cascades	Blood coagulation is a series of coordinated and calcium-dependent proenzyme-to-serine protease conversions likely to be localized on the surfaces of activated cells in vivo. It culminates in the formation of thrombin, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin clotThe kallikrein-kinin system is an endogenous metabolic cascade, triggering of which results in the release of vasoactive kinins (bradykinin-related peptides). Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioningComplement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogensSource: KEGG Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP558 CPTAC Assay Portal]	C9,F10,F7,MASP2,C5R1,PLAU,CPB2,SERPIND1,KLKB1,THBD,MBL1,PROS1,KNG1,F12,Hc,CFI,C6,MCP,PLAT,TFPI,F9,CLU,C3,C7,PLAUR,C1QB,C1QA,SERPINA5,CRRY,H2-BF,C8G,C3AR1,109821,F3,MASP1,A2M,SERPING1,C1S,VWF,SERPINF2,C1R,FGB,SERPINA1,PLG,PROC,CD59A,BDKRB1,CFH,F8,CR2,SERPINE1,ADN,SERPINC1,F13B,Daf2,C2,C4,CR1,F5,F2R,Daf1,C1QG,F2

Type I Interferon Induction and Signaling During SARS-CoV-2 Infection	The induction of Type I interferons and signaling is the first response leading to the innate immune reactions during SARS-COV-2 infection. The virus can enter host cells through two mechanisms. If it enters the cell via diffusion mediated by TMPRSS2, the virus ssRNA will be detected by RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol. If the virus enters the cell via endocytosis, the spike proteins will be processed by CTSL in the lysosome leading to the detection of ssRNA by TLR3,7 and 9 (PMID 33506952). The extracellular virus can also be detected by TLR2,4 and 6 (PMID 33506952). The higher production of TLR4 in men and the presence of TLR7 on the X chromosome may contribute to the different responses between women and men during SARS-CoV 2 infection (PMID 33506952). TLR7 MYD88-dependent signaling is inhibited at multiple steps by the SARS-CoV Papain-Like Protease (PLpro) domain of nsp3 (red oval). The signaling pathway is critical to induction of type I interferons (INF-I) via IRF3, AP-1 and NFkB transcription factors. INF-I triggers the JAK/STAT pathway leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as OAS and PKR, which go one to conduct the innate immune response. TREML4 has been shown to be necessary for MYD88 recruitment by TLR7 and STAT1 participation. The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by GRL0617 is proposed based on Ratia, et al. 2008 and 100% sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 across all 13 residues of PLpro involved in binding GRL0617 (82.9% identity across 316 amino acids) as determined by the alignment of RefSeq YP_009725299.1 and PDB 3E9S (https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/#Nsp3_PLpro_domain). The antimicrobial agent, azithromycin, is in clincal trials as COVID-19 therapy in combination with hydroxychloroquine (Gautret 2020) has been shown to modulate inflammation by inhibiting the activation of many of these same transcription factors.

Proximal tubule transport	This pathway provides an overview of all active transport that occurs in the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys. The proximal tubule plays roles in regulating the pH of the filtrate, secreting organic waste, and reabsorption of NaCl, a large variety of solutes, and amino acids from the filtrate back into the circulation. The apical side indicates the proximal tubule which contains the filtrate after passing through Bowman's capsule, which later becomes the urine after passing through the complete nephron, from which solutes are reabsorbed (taken back into the body) and into which waste is secreted. Impaired ability of reabsorption by the proximal tubule can lead to Fanconi syndrome.

Acetylcholine Synthesis	Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter. It can be rapidly released in the synaptic cleft upon activation of the neuron.

GPR40 Pathway	G-protein-coupled receptor GPR40 (also known as Free fatty acid receptor 1(FFAR1)) is a seven trans-membrane domain receptor which is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells. It plays an essential role in fatty acid ampliï¬�cation of glucose induced insulin secretion. GPR40 agonists are in second phase of preclinical trials for treatment of diabetes because of their role in improved glucose control.Binding of free fatty acids to GPR40 initiates a downstream signaling cascade which involves activation of a transducer protein â€œguanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11â€�  (GNA11). Next phospholipase c (PLC) hormone is activated which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol-4-5-biphosphate) into second messenger molecules inositol-1-4-5-trophosphate (IP3) and Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 initiates calcium efflux from endoplasmic reticulum and increase intracellular calcium concentration.  Increased intracellular calcium concentration is involved in activating the insulin exocytosis machinery. DAG on the other hand activates PKD1. PKD1 initiates F-actin remodeling and supports second phase of insulin exocytosis. 	Unknown target &#xA;genes,PLCB2,PLCD1,PLCB1,PLCG2,PKD1,PLCB3,PLCD3,PLCL1,PLCH1,PLCZ1,PLCG1,PLCE1,IP3R,GNA11,GPR40
Cannabinoid receptor signaling	Endogenous cannabinoid receptors belong to the endocannabinoid system and are located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The endocannabinoid system is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Two primary endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CNR1 and CNR2. CNR1 is found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule), Anandamide, as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD (cannabidiol). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain managementSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system Not all MAPK subtypes are relevant for this pathway. The relevant types have been separately added on the right side of the pathway.Source: Howlett A.C. Cannabinoid Receptor Signaling. In: Pertwee R.G. (eds) Cannabinoids.

Cori Cycle	The Cori cycle (also known as the Lactic acid cycle), named after its discoverers, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori, refers to the metabolic pathway in which lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles moves to the liver and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles and is metabolized back to lactate.Muscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown of glycogen in the skeletal muscles. The breakdown of glycogen, a process known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P). The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G-6-P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the Krebs cycle. When oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism. Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Most importantly, fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining the NAD+ concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate.Instead of accumulating inside the muscle cells, lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver. This initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesisOverall, the glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules indicates that the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liverSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1946 CPTAC Assay Portal]	GPT,Enolase,Insulin,GPI,PGK1,GAPDH,G6PD,Hexokinase,SLC2A4,Gluconolactonase,Pyruvate Kinase,TALDO1,PFKP,Isomerase,SLC2A2,PGAM1,PGK2,LDHA,TPI1,SLC2A1
Regulatory circuits of the STAT3 signaling pathway	STAT3 activation works through phosphorylation on at tyrosine 705 by a variety of adaptor kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2, SRC), resulting in dimers of STAT3 that translocates into the nucleus. Those adaptor kinases can be activated by a variety of receptors in response to cytokines or growth factors. Besides, an additional phosphate group can be added at serine 727 on each STAT3 (by MAPKs, mTOR, PKC), which enhances the transcriptional activity of STAT3 or directs STAT3 towards the mitochondria. Inside the nucleus, the STAT3 dimers are regulated by a variety of modifying factors, such as acetylation at lysine 685 by histone acetyltransferases, methylation at lysine 140 by histone methyltransferases to favor or impair STAT3 transcriptional activity, respectively. Other regulators of STAT3 include phosphatases (such as PTPRD, SOCS3, TRIM28, PIAS3) and miRNAs.

Bladder Cancer	The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of  E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2828 CPTAC Assay Portal]	CCND1,TYMP,RB1,DAPK1,E2F1,BRAF,DAPK3,THBS1,NRAS,CDK4,CDH1,MMP1,KRAS,VEGFA,MMP9,MAP2K2,ERBB2,UPK3A,MMP2,EGFR,HBEGF,MAP2K1,MDM2,FGFR3,MSK1,ARAF,SRC,IL8,CDKN1A,RAF1,p85-ALPHA,EGF,MAPK1,RASSF1,CDKN2A,HRAS,p85-Beta,TP53,C-MYC,DAPK2
Development and heterogeneity of the ILC family	Development and heterogeneity of the ILC family. ILCs develop from distinct progenitors in the fetal liver or bone marrow and then develop into mature ILCs in the periphery. Different transcription factors and cytokines are involved in the development of the three groups of mature ILCs. All ILCs develop from CLPs, which can differentiate into NKps or CHILPs. CHILPs can further differentiate into LTi cells through α4β7+ populations or into other ILC populations through differentiation into ILCps. ILC1s express T-bet, are responsive to IL-12, and produce IFN-γ and/or TNF. ILC2s highly express GATA3, are responsive to IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, and produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 and amphiregulin.

Kit receptor signaling pathway	Kit is a cytokine receptor that belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. It is structurally similar to platelet-derived growth factor recpetors (PDGFRs), colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and fms-like tyrosine kinase. Kit signaling is plays important role in a number of physiological processes including erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, mast cell development and function, megakaryopoiesis, gametogenesis and melanogenesis. Sequence alterations in the c-kit gene are found to be associated with different cancers including hematopoietic malignancies, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, germ cell tumors, small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The primary ligand for kit receptor is stem cell factor (SCF). It is also known as Kit ligand, steel factor or mast cell growth factor. SCF is a glycosylated, non-covalent homodimer. Alternative splicing and proteolytic cleavage results in soluble and membrane bound forms of the protein. that binds to two KIT monomers. Binding of SCF to KIT results in the dimerization of the receptor and its autophsphorylation. The residues that are known to get phosphorylated upon ligand binding include Tyr568, Tyr570, Tyr703, Tyr721, Tyr730, Tyr823, Tyr 900 and Tyr936. Signaling events downstream of the KIT receptor are well studied. Among the signaling cascades that are activated are the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathways. KIT stimulation is also known to activate the JAK/STAT and PLC/PKC signaling pathways. Among the other key proteins that are regulated by KIT are the kinases BTK, TEC, LYN, SRC, FYN and JNK. Regulation of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase occurs through many mechanisms. Activated KIT receptors are degraded via CBL, a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. CBL induces the degradation of the receptor via the proteasome or lysosome. KIT can also be dephosphorylated and inactivated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp1. Also, activation of protein kinase C results in a negative feedback loop, wherein it phosphorylates specific serine residues leading to the inactivation of KIT.

Proteasome Degradation	Degradation by proteasomes is part of  the mechanism by which cells regulate the concentration of proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteasomes are protein complexes which degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Proteins are tagged for degradation by proteasomes by the addition of ubiquitin, by ubiquitin ligasesDescription adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome Wikipedia].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP183 CPTAC Assay Portal]	UBC,PSMD10,PSMD4,HLA-J,UBE2D3,PSME2,PSMD5,PSMB7,PSMB8,PSMB4,PSMD7,PSMD3,PSMB5,H2AFZ,HIST1H2AB,UBE2D1,PSMA1,PSMC3,HLA-H,UBE1L,UBE2D2,HLA-F,PSMD12,PSMA2,PSMB1,PSMD2,H2AFX,PSMA7,UCHL1,IFNG,PSME3,UBB,UBE1,PSMB3,HLA-A,PSMC6,NEDD4,PSMB6,PSMD9,PSMD6,PSMC1,PSMA6,PSMA5,PSMD11,PSMB10,UBE2B,PSMB2,PSMC4,PSMC2,PSMA4,PSMD13,RPN2,HLA-G,PSMA3,HLA-B,HLA-E,PSMC5,UCHL3,PSME1,HLA-C,PSMD1,PSMB9,RPN1,PSMD8
Nucleotide Excision Repair	Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism that repairs DNA damaged by UV radiation.This type of damage produces bulky distortions in the shape of DNA double helix due to the addition of DNA adducts, mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts.Recognition of distortions leads to the removal of a short single-stranded DNA segment that includes the lesion, creating a single-strand gap in the DNA, which is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the undamaged strand as a template. NER can be divided into two subpathways (Global genomic NER and Transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition of helix-distorting DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair has more complexity in eukaryotes. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a particularly important DNA repair mechanism as evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins including Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome.This pathway was adapted from [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03420 KEGG], [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/2/ REPAIRtoire] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_excision_repair Wikipedia].

Development of pulmonary dendritic cells and macrophage subsets	Development of pulmonary DC and macrophage subsets. This model of pulmonary DC and macrophage subset differentiation in mice summarizes recent findings suggesting early lineage commitment of cDCs in the BM and differentiation of monocytes into different population with DC, macrophage, or suppressive functions. All DC subsets present in the lung originate from hematopoietic progenitors (HSC) that differentiate into a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). Such CMPs further differentiate to a common DC progenitors (CDPs) or macrophage DC progenitors (MDPs). MDPs give rise to a common monocyte precursor (cMoP). In a CSF-1-dependent mechanism, Ly6Chi monocytes develop, which can further differentiate into Ly6Clo monocytes. Such Ly6Clo monocytes may also derive directly from cMoPs. Both monocyte populations can enter the lung and become monocyte-derived DCs, macrophages, or suppressor cells (25, 62). CDPs also serve as precursors for pDCs and pre-cDCs. Recent studies suggest that the two cDC populations deriving from the pre-cDC progenitor, i.e., CD103+ cDCs and CD11b+ cDCs, arise already in the bone marrow as pre-cDC1/cDC2 subtypes. One study suggested that pulmonary monocytes may differentiate into pulmonary CD103+ and CD11b+ DC; however, it is unclear whether such cells are phenotypically and functionally identical to CD103+ and CD11b+ cDCs. Activation of defined transcription factors (in blue) at distinct time points is critical for lineage commitment of the different DC precursors. During the early developmental stages, important transcription factors include STAT3, IRF8, and PU.1. At later stages, E2-2 is decisive for pDC commitment of CDPs. BATF3 and IRF8 are associated with the CD103+ cDC and IRF4 with the CD11b+ differentiation. In addition to the transcription factors, several growth factors (in green) play key functions in the development of pre-cDCs and the different DC subsets, in particular Flt3L, CSF-1 (M-CSF), and CSF-2 (GM-CSF). The lung contains two major macrophage populations, i.e., alveolar and interstitial macrophages (AMs and IMs, respectively). It is now well appreciated that AMs derive from yolk sac and fetal liver progenitors that colonize the embryonic lung and are maintained by self-renewal at steady state. The origin of IMs remains elusive. Some data suggest that they represent monocyte-derived macrophages.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3892 CPTAC Assay Portal]	FLT3L,BATF3,E2-2,STAT3,IRF8,CSF1,CSF2,ID2,TPO,PU.1,Ikaros,IRF4,RUNX2
Fragile X Syndrome 	Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenetic disorder cause by a mutation in the FMR1 gene and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patients with FXS show a range of typical physical features such as macro-orchidism in males, a long and narrow face, large and protruding ears and hyperextensible joints. Common comorbidities of FXS are neuropsychiatric disorders such as hyperactivity, depression and anxiety.The mutation of FMR1 in FXS disrupts production of the FMR1 gene product, the fragile mental retardation protein (FMRP). The main function of FMRP is to locally act as a translational repressor for target mRNAs and thereby regulate de novo protein synthesis and ultimately synaptic plasticity. FMRP, together with the mTOR pathway and the ERK pathway regulates expression of target mRNAsn mediated by stimulation of Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) and thereby regulate  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) internalisation and thus long term depression (LTD).  LTD is a form of synaptic plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. Lack of FMRP leads to exaggerated mGluR dependant LTD, which accounts for most of FXS pathogenesis.

Soluble ACE2-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-2	ACE2 is a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. To perform this function, ACE2 is transported to the cell surface, where it is cleaved by disintegrin and ADAM17 to produce an enzymatically active soluble form of ACE2. This soluble form retains the SARS-CoV-2 binding site. SARS-CoV-2 bound to either soluble ACE2 or soluble ACE2 and vasopressin then uses receptor-mediated endocytosis by through either AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively.

Netrin-UNC5B signaling Pathway	UNC-5 Homolog B (UNC5B) is a member of the dependence receptor family. It can induce two opposite intracellular signaling cascades depending on the presence or absence of the ligand and is thus capable of driving two opposing processes.

In addition, inhibition of the ligand has been reported to decrease invasiveness and angiogenesis in tumors. UNC5B signaling pathway has also been reported to be involved in several processes such as neural development, developmental angiogenesis and inflammatory processes.

IL-3 Signaling Pathway	Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a potent growth factor belonging to the super family of cytokines. IL-3 is a 20- 32kDa glycoprotein involved in the process of hematopoiesis. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pleuripotent hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and their mature progeny. IL-3 is a growth factor for B lymphocytes. It also activates monocytes and augments survival and propagation of mast cells, eosinophils and stromal cells. IL-3 is secreted predominantly by activated T lymphocytes in response to immunological stimuli and to a lesser extent by mast cells and eosinophils. IL-3 exerts influence on different biological activities, primarily hematopoiesis by associating with the IL-3 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex and consists of an alpha chain- IL3RA and a beta chain CSF2RB, shared with the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and Interleukin-5. When IL-3 binds to CSF2RB receptor, adapter proteins like SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1 are recruited to activate HRAS. HRAS stimulates RAF1 which further activates MAP2K1 and finally MAPK1 and MAPK3. The signals generated through this pathway are then transmitted to the nucleus leading to the activation of various transcription factors such as JUN and FOS which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. IL-3 mediated activation of HRAS also inhibits apoptosis through phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/ AKT pathway. The activation of AKT1 in response to IL-3 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the apoptotic regulator, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), its binding to 14-3-3 and sequestration into the cytoplasm. IL-3 stimulation activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by its phosphorylation. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B. These translocate to the nucleus, serving the purpose of transcription factor for early genes as well as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway. IL-3, in addition, is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, FYN, SRC, SYK, TEC1 and HCK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical IL-3 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway mapPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_3_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

DNA IR-Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) and cellular response via ATM	Wide-ranging correlations are found between the initial physical features of radiation exposure and the possibility of biological consequences. These persist even with the chain of physical, chemical and biological processes that eliminate the majority of the early damage.Ionizing radiations (IRs) generate hundreds of different simple chemical products in DNA as well multitudes of clustered combinations. The simple products, including single-strand breaks (SSBs), tend to correlate poorly with biological effectiveness. However, when IR produce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA it comes a large rise in relative biological response to cellular damage. In general terms, IRs produce a wide variety of DNA lesions and DSBs are considered to be the major actor responsible for cell death. If unrepaired or improperly repaired, DSBs contribute to chromosomal aberrations, which may lead to human disorders including cancer. The accurate preservation of chromosome continuity in human cells during either DNA replication or repair is critical for preventing the conversion of normal cells to an oncogenic status.The production of DSBs can be quantified by biochemical techniques, e.g., pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and cell imaging, either globally or damage specific, through immunostaining of marker proteins or recruitment of fluorescent proteins to the DNA breaks.In vertebrate cells, the elimination of DSBs with minimal nucleotide sequence change involves the spatiotemporal orchestration of an apparently endless number of proteins ranging, according to their action, from the nucleotide level to nucleosome organization and chromosome architecture. DSBs trigger a multitude of post-translational modifications that alter both, catalytic activities and the specificity of protein interactions including: phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, followed by the turnaround of these changes as repair has been completed.In mammalian cells, the formation of DSBs initiates a massive global cellular response, either checkpoint signaling and repair or cell death (apoptosis). A major role is that of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex binding to DSBs and facilitating the activation of ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) protein, a key PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) related kinase in the DNA damage response (DDR). At the break site, ATM autophosphorylates, allowing its activation and the following phosphorylation of several substrates in the surrounding chromatinThe following pathway diagrams the early events of the cellular response after DSBs by IR through the activation of ATM in human cells.

TCA Cycle Nutrient Utilization and Invasiveness of Ovarian Cancer	Schematic showing the shift in nutrient utilization in TCA cycle with increasing degree of invasiveness. Low-invasive ovarian cancer (OVCA) cells are glucose dependent for their TCA cycle pool. With increasing invasiveness in cancer cells, dominant nutrient which feeds the TCA cycle shifts from glucose to Gln. In high-invasive OVCA cells, Gln dominates the TCA cycle. In low-invasive OVCA cells, glucose activates Jak1, which activates STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby regulating glycolysis in cancer cells. In highinvasive OVCA cells, besides glucose's role in activating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, glutamine activates JAK1 through TCA cycle to further activate STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation and thus regulate glycolysis. Further, Gln activates Erk1/2, which subsequently activates STAT3 by serine phosphorylation selectively in high-invasive OVCA cells. The serine phosphorylation of STAT3 enhances oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by interaction with mitochondrial complexes I and II, thereby increasing TCA cycle activity in high-invasive OVCA cells.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2868 CPTAC Assay Portal]	JAK1,ERK2,EGFR,ERK1,STAT3
Intracellular trafficking proteins involved in CMT neuropathy	Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is one of the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies. This peripheral neuropathy is highly heterogeneous (clinically and genetically) and is characterized by a slowly progressive degeneration of the muscle of the foot, lower leg, hand and forearm, accompanied by sensory loss in the toes, fingers and limbs. Mutations in genes involved in intracellular trafficking are increasingly being implicated in various human diseases, including neuronal diseases.

Vitamin D Metabolism	Photochemical synthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, D3) occurs cutaneously where pro-vitamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol) is converted to pre-vitamin D3 (pre-D3) in response to ultraviolet B (sunlight) exposure. DHCR7 encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase, which converts 7-DHC to cholesterol, thereby removing the substrate from the synthetic pathway of vitamin D3, a precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.The finding that common variants at DHCR7 are strongly associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations suggests that this enzyme could have a larger role in regulation of vitamin D status than has previously been recognised. Vitamin D3, obtained from the isomerization of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal basal layers or intestinal absorption of natural and fortified foods and supplements, binds to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. D3 is hydroxylated by liver 25-hydroxylases (25-OHase). The resultant 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) is 1-hydroxylated in the kidney by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 -hydroxylase (1-OHase). This yields the active secosteroid 1 ,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), which has different effects on various target tissues. The synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)D3 is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and suppressed by Ca2+, Pi and 1,25(OH)2D3 itself. The rate-limiting step in catabolism is the degradation of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 to 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3, respectively,which occurs through 24-hydroxylation by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase), encoded by the CYP24A1 gene. 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3 are consequently excreted. Vitamin D activity is mediated through binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which can regulate transcription of other genes involved in cell regulation, growth, and immunity. VDR modulates the expression of genes by forming a heterodimer complex with retinoid-X-receptors (RXR).Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1531 CPTAC Assay Portal].	alpha-globulin,RXRB,DHCR7,VDR,CYP2R1 ,RXRA,CYP27B1,CYP24A1,Vitamin D binding protein,CYP27A1,Parathyroid hormone
Neural Crest Cell Migration during Development	During normal neuronal development, neural crest cells participate in migration and invasion processes. The growth factor, BDNF, binds to and activates NGFR (p75NTR) in various contexts, invoking signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional activation in the nucleus.

TLR4 Signaling and Tolerance	This pathway is based on the figure 2 of "Toll-like Receptors: Novel Pharmacological Targets for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases" and figure 2 of "Toll-like receptor and its roles in myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury" (see bibliography). The Toll-like receptors are used by mammals to recognize pathogen-associated molecules such as the cell wall components. The activation of TLR4 causes a cell's inability to produce TNFa. TLR4 deals with MyD88 independent and dependent pathways, and due to LPS tolerant cells, inhibitors of the MyD88 dependent pathway are increased. TLR is important in the creation of protective immune responses to cancers, and the protection of brain tissue from injury.

Valproic acid pathway	Valproic acid is a drug used for treatment and management of seizure disorders, mania and prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. In epileptics, valproic acid is used to control absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal), complex partial seizures, and the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.Valproic Acid dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract and then binds to and inhibits GABA transaminase. The drug's anticonvulsant activity may be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Valproic Acid may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. It is also a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Valproic acid has also been shown to be an inhibitor of an enzyme called histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 is needed for HIV to remain in infected cells. A study published in August 2005 revealed that patients treated with valproic acid in addition to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed a 75% reduction in latent HIV infection.Source: description from http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00313Metabolic pathway from: http://smpdb.ca/view/SMP00635Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3871 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Somatroph axis (GH) and its relationship to dietary restriction and aging	The somatotrophic axis in mammals comprises the growth hormone (GH), which is produced by the anterior pituitary, and its secondary mediator, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The intracellular signaling pathway of IGF-1 is the same as that elicited by insulin, which informs cells of the presence of glucose. For this reason, IGF-1 and insulin signaling are known as the insulin and IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway. Remarkably, the IIS pathway is the most conserved aging-controlling pathway in evolution, and among its multiple targets are the FOXO family of transcription factors and the mTOR complexes, which are also involved in aging and conserved through evolution. Genetic polymorphisms or mutations that reduce the functions of GH, IGF-1 receptor, insulin receptor, or downstream intracellular effectors such as AKT, mTOR, and FOXO have been linked to longevity. Molecules that favor aging are shown in orange, and molecules with anti-aging properties are shown in light green.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4186 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Tgif disruption of Shh signaling	Mutations in the Sonic Hedgehog(SHH) gene result in HPE in humans and mice, and the Shh pathway is targeted by other mutations that cause holoprosencephaly (HPE). HPE is a severe human genetic disease affecting craniofacial development of children.  The TGIF1 gene maps to the HPE4, and the heterozygous loss of the TGIF1 mutations are associated with HPE, however mouse models have yet to explain how the inhibition of TGIF causes the genetic disease Holoprosencephaly.  Using a conditional Tgif1 allele, Taniguchi, et al. showed that mouse embryos lacking both Tgif1 and the related Tgif2 have HPE-like phenotypes reminiscent of Shh null embryos.

Type I collagen synthesis in the context of Osteogenesis imperfecta	Type I collagen — the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in bone, skin and tendon — is mainly secreted by osteoblasts, dermal fibroblasts and tenocytes. Despite the relatively simple structure of the collagen triple helix, the biosynthesis of type I procollagen is extremely complex, involving multiple steps and requiring an ensemble of proteins for post-translational modifications, folding, transport, secretion and quality control. The COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcripts are translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and the α(I)‑chains undergo a series of post-translational modifications. Helical prolines in position Y of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat are hydroxylated in position C4 by prolyl 4‑hydroxylase 1 (P4H1), whereas specific prolines in the X positions are 3‑hydroxylated by P3H1 and P3H2. Some lysine residues are hydroxylated by lysyl hydroxylases (LH1 and LH2, encoded by PLOD1 and PLOD2 respectively), and glycosylation of hydroxylysines into galactosyl-hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine is catalysed by procollagen galactosyltransferase 1 and procollagen glucosyltransferase 1. After synthesis of the carboxy-terminal propeptide, it forms intra-chain disulfide bonds and remains attached to the rER membrane. Selection and association of the correct chains into a triple helix occur by diffusion of the C-propeptides attached to the rER membrane. A nucleus for triple helix formation is formed that staggers the chains in the correct order and initiates triple helix formation. Protein disulfide isomerase catalyses inter-chain disulfide bond formation, which stabilize the folding nucleus. Hydroxylation of proline residues and some lysine residues continues and triple helix formation proceeds from the C-terminal end towards the amino-terminal end. During this phase, 65 kDa FK506‑binding protein (FKBP65; encoded by FKBP10) and a complex formed by P3H1 — CRTAP– PPIase B (peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase B) — seem to play a crucial part. The complex is involved in the Hydroxylation of proline 986 of the collagen α1(I)-chain and α1(II)-chain and proline 707 of the α2(I)-chain, which are thought to be important for supramolecular assembly of collagen fibrils and to serve as binding sites for chaperones or small leucine-rich proteoglycans. Beyond its prolyl 3‑hydroxylase activity, the complex functions as a PPIase and chaperone for collagen folding. Indeed, the fast propagation of the triple helix requires the isomerization of cis peptide bonds that convert proline residues into trans configuration, mainly by PPIase B24. When most of the helix is folded, the N-propeptides associate and form the small triple helix within this domain. The newly formed triple helix is stabilized by serpin H1 (also known as HSP47; encoded by SERPINH1) and FKBP65. Further modifications occur during transport from the rER to the Golgi apparatus in special coat protein complex vesicles that contain melanoma inhibitory activity protein 3 (also known as TANGO1, encoded by MIA) and through the Golgi stack by cisternal maturation. Serpin H1 also has binding sites along the helical portion of the molecule and assists shuttling of folded collagen into the cis-Golgi. These biosynthetic steps depend on a proper rER environment (for example, optimal calcium levels and redox potential), and the quality-control mechanisms can lead to the activation of the unfolded protein response using the ER-associated degradation pathway or the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation system to eliminate molecules that were not properly folded. Once secreted, the propeptides of procollagen are cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 2 (ADAMTS2) and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) into mature type I collagen. This initiates collagen fibre formation and these fibrils are stabilized by crosslink formation, in which certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues in the triple helix and the  telopeptides are oxidized by lysyl oxidases and converted into allysine and hydroxyallysine. These residues then initially form divalent crosslinks that convert into mature trivalent pyridinoline and pyrrole crosslinks to stabilize the fibril structure in tissues.Bone formation consists of the secretion of bone extracellular matrix components (mainly type I collagen) by osteoblasts. The unmineralized bone matrix (osteoid) subsequently becomes mineralized. In addition, osteoblasts and osteocytes release many cytokines, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) and osteoprotegerin (OPG, encoded by TNFRSF11B), which regulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. RANKL acts on osteoclast precursor cells by binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK; also known as TNFRSF11A) on their surface, thereby favouring their differentiation to osteoclasts. OPG, by interacting with RANKL, prevents the binding of RANKL to RANK. Some osteoblasts become embedded in the mineralized bone matrix and differentiate to osteocytes, which produce, among other factors, sclerostin, an inhibitor of the WNT pathway that is known to stimulate bone formation by stimulating osteoblast activity.Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.Adapted from [5]	LRP5,CREB3L1,TNFRSF11A,P3H1,ADAMTS2,TNFRSF11B,P4HA2,FKBP10,PLOD1,COL1A1,COL1A2,MBTPS2,IFITM5,P4HB,MBTPS1,SP7,TMEM38B,LRP6,P4HA1,ITPR1,SERPINH1,SERPINF1,COLGALT1,MIA3,PPIB,BMP1,P3H2,FZD1,LOX,PLOD2,WNT1,TNFSF11,CRTAP

Alternatively, they may be N-hydroxylated by CYPIA2, trans - ported to the bladder, and undergo O-acetylation by NATI, to form a highly reactive species.

Oxysterols derived from cholesterol	The Oxysterol group of compounds are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol or its sterol precursors, e.g. 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) or desmosterol. There are three mechanisms leading to the formation of oxysterols: 1. Enzymatically (first steps of sterol metabolism, being intermediates for the formation of steroid hormones, bile acids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3).2. Non-enzymatically by encountering reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing a second pool of metabolites (this pool also includes oxidized cholesterol molecules taken in from diet), see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5064 WP5064].3. Generation by the gut microflora and uptake through the enterohepatic circulationPreviously oxysterols where though to be inactive metabolic intermediates, however recent findings have established that these metabolites are involved in cholesterol homoeostasis, can be ligands to nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors and biomarkers of diseases (for example Niemann-Pick disease).This pathway drawing was inspired by Figure 3 of the review article by Griffiths et al.

ID signaling pathway	The Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins belong to the class V HLH family of transcription factors. Four ID proteins (ID 1-4)are known in humans. Unlike the basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, ID proteins lack the basic DNA binding region. They can heterodimerize with class I bHLH transcription factors to form inactive complexes. They thus act as dominant negative inhibitors of the class I bHLH transcription factors. They are also capable of regulating the activity of class II HLH transcription factors. Since, class I and II HLH proteins regulate the expression of cell type-specific genes and differentiated phenotype, ID proteins are thought to regulate the cross-talk between the pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant expression of ID proteins are found in many primary tumors and are found to regulate many steps in cancer progression including neo-angiogenesis, invasion and migration, proliferation and growth, cell-cell interaction and differentiation. These include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinonoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer  and prostate cancer. Among the transcription factors that ID proteins associate with are the Ets family members (ELKs)  and paired box family (PAXs). They can also bind to the retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma-like proteins (RBLs), which are thought to be tumor suppressors. IDs can also be phosphorylated by CDK2 Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/id_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

FBXL10 enhancement of MAP/ERK signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	FBXL10, a member of Polycomb repressive complexes, is overexpressed in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tissues and cell lines. FBXL10 silences the expression of DUSP6 through recruitment of polycomb repressuive complexes, which leads to the deposition of repressive histone modifications in the DUPS6 promoter. DUSP6 is a ERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3) phosphatase and with lower levels of DUSP6, ERK1/2 remain phosphorylated and thus activates downstream ERK/MAPK signaling and ultimately cell proliferationBased on figure 7 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5833345/ Zhao et al]	HIST2H3A,H2AFY,HIST1H3B,HIST1H3A,HIST1H3I,H2AFY2,SUZ12,H2AFZ,H3,HIST1H3E,HIST1H3G,H2AFB3,HIST1H3J,H3F3B,H2AFX,BCL6,HIST1H3D,HIST2H3D,H2A,H2AFV,HIST1H3C,HIST2H3C,H3F3A,H2AFB2,EZH2,EED,MAPK1,HIST1H3H,H2AFB1,FBXL10,PCGF1,BCOR,MAPK3,HIST1H3F,RNF2,H2AFJ,DUSP6
IL-2 Signaling Pathway	IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor, but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2 clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate, or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2RÃŽÂ± alone) is not functional; signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2RÃŽÂ±, IL-2RÃŽÂ² and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2RÃŽÂ³ and now generally denoted as ÃŽÂ³c) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-2RÃŽÂ² and ÃŽÂ³c. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2RÃŽÂ² and ÃŽÂ³c, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2RÃŽÂ² and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signalsPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_2_pathway.html NetSlim] database.

Cerebral Organic Acidurias, including diseases	This pathway shows disorders related to the accumulation of organic acids in body fluids, resulting in cerebral organic acidurias. Symptoms often include mental or motor retardation, difficulties while moving and epilepsy. For all but one disorder, current treatment options have been proven ineffective. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 8 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).	
IL-9 Signaling Pathway	IL-9 is a multifunctional cytokine, belonging to a family of cytokines. IL-9 was initially reported as a T cell growth factor in mice. It is now known to target multiple cell types. It plays an important role in the expansion and recruitment of mast cells in response to intestinal nematode infection or during autoimmune encephalomyelitis. It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. IL-9 can promote the expression of TGF-beta in lipopolysaccharide-induced monocytes and macrophages. IL-9 is also known to play important roles in conditions including airway inflammation, EAE and parasitic infections. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated transiently by IL-9, which in turn leads to the growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines. IL-9 signals through the heterodimeric receptor composed of a specific chain (IL-9R) and a gamma chain (IL2RG), which is shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL15 and IL-21. The IL-9R and IL-2RG associates with JAK1 and JAK3 respectively. Receptor engagement results in JAK1- JAK3 cross phosphorylation and activation of the JAK proteins which leads to the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5) and Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2)/PI3K cascades. IL-9 stimulation also results in the activation of MEK/ERK signaling cascade.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_9_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBP) signalling	Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound proteins that act as transcription factors. They regulate lipid, especially cholesterol, biosynthesis and uptake at a transcriptional level to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis. In addition, SREBP appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes. This pathway of SREBP focusses on the regulation of lipid metabolism by SREBP. The data on which this pathway is based, is derived from a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies using different species, including mouse, rat, hamster and human.This pathway served as the basis for a review about SREBP that was published in Genes and Nutrition: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23516131 PubMed].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1982 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) signaling pathway	Human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary lobe, which plays an important physiological role in regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid by stimulating production and secretion of the thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland. TSH binds to TSH receptor which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins. TSH exerts its action through various signaling cascades such as cAMP cascade and the phospholipase C beta-mediated inositol phosphate generation. Further, it will give signaling to NF-kappa B, mitogen activated protein kinases, protein kinase C modules.NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project between PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and the Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).

Interleukin-11 Signaling Pathway	IL-11 is a multifunctional cytokine that belongs to the gp130 family. It was first isolated from a primate bone marrow derived cell line, PU-34 for its ability to stimulate the proliferation of a plasmacytoma cell line, T1165 which was dependent on IL-6. This cytokine plays an important role in the synthesis, maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It  also plays significant role in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, regulation of trophoblasts invasion and placentation in humans. The receptor for IL-11 is IL11RA that uses the common gp130 receptor subunit for signal transduction. The pathways that are activated upon IL-11 stimulation are JAK-STAT, Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65. Binding of IL-11 with IL-11RA results in the heterodimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of gp130. The activated IL11RA-gp130 receptor complex further activates Jak family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 then activates STAT3 and STAT1 that results in their subsequent translocation into the nucleus. The translocated STAT3 then induces the transcription of genes associated with endometrial cell adhesion, gastric inflammation and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells. The activation of STAT3 was shown to be inhibited by the overexpression of Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). IL-11 signalling through JAK2/STAT3 has been shown to be crucial for normal placentation in humans and normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth in mice.In addition to JAK-STAT, IL-11 also activate the Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B pathways. In response to IL-11, GTP loaded Ras interacts with RAF1 and leads to autophosphorylation of RAF1. Activation of RAF1 leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) through MEK1 and MEK2. Activation of phospholipase D was triggered by IL-11 leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid, which has also been shown to activate the MAPKs. Transcription factors, ATF1 and CREB1 were activated by these phosphorylated MAPKs through p90 S6 kinase. PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65 pathways stimulated by IL-11 have been shown to enhance the migration and proliferation of chondrosarcoma cells. In CD4+ T cells, Th2 polarization was induced by IL-11 through NF-kappa B inhibition. SRC, FYN and YES, members of Src family of tyrosine kinases were also activated in response to IL-11 signalling.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_11_pathway NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2332 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MAP2K2,IL11,ITGA2,PIK3R1,JAK1,BCL2,PTPN11,PIAS1,RPS6,ICAM1,IL11RA,TYK2,CHUK,GRB2,IL6ST,PPP2R4,BGLAP,FYN,JAK2,MAPK1,STAT1,HRAS,ATF1,IKBKB,RPS6KA1,MAPK3,BIRC5,RAF1,RPS6KB1,CREB1,YES1,IBSP,RUNX2,PIAS3,PDPK1,SRC,TGFB1,AKT1,STAT3,PIK3R2,RELA,MAP2K1,SOCS3,FES

Mammary gland development pathway - Pregnancy and lactation (Stage 3 of 4)	The secondary mammary gland can be inactive or active. It becomes active during pregnancy and lactation, when there is a formation of alveoli, the structure responsible for milk production.There are four signal inputs for the mammary gland development during pregnancy and lactation: (1) prolactin receptor (PRLR), (2) epidermal growth factor receptors (ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4), (3) estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and (4) progesterone receptor (PGR)In the first case, PRL binds to PRLR, allowing its phosphorylation by JAK2, and the consequent coupling of STAT5 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1]. JAK2 phosphorylates STAT5, allowing its migration to nucleus. STAT5 target genes are related to proliferation (TNFSF11, CCND1), differentiation (CSN2, WFDC, ELF5, GJB2) and survival (BCL2L1) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422 1].

PDGF Pathway	PDGF belongs to the PDGF/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family, which is characterized by eight strictly conserved cysteine residues with similar spacing in between (Joukov et al., 1997; Heldin and Westermark, 1999). The A-, B-, C-, and D-chain genes of PDGF are localized to the chromosomes 7p22, 22q13, 4q31, and 11q22, respectively, and their expression is independently regulated. Two forms of the PDGF A-chain, containing 196 and 211 amino acid residues resulting from differential splicing of the transcript, are synthesized, dimerized, proteolytically processed in the Nterminus, and secreted from the cell as a ~30 kDa dimer. The PDGF B chain encoding 241 amino acid residues is dimerized, processed by additional proteolysis, and secreted as a 24 kDa dimer. The homodimers PDGF AA, BB, and the heterodimer AB contain three intrachain disulfide bonds made between the 1stProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2526 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MAP3K1&#xA;(MEKK1),P&#xA;D&#xA;G&#xA;F&#xA;A,NFkB,MAPK1,SRF,PDGFB,PLA2G4A&#xA;(cPLA2),PLCG1,MAPK3,MP2K1&#xA;(MEK 1),RASA1(GAP),MAPK8&#xA;(JNK1),MAP2K4&#xA;(JNKK1),PDGFRB,ELK1,SH-PTP2&#xA;(PTN11),c-Fos,H-Ras-1&#xA;(Ras),AP-1&#xA;(c-Jun),IkB alpha

ERK Pathway in Huntington's Disease	This ERK pathway is implicated in Huntington's Disease. The ligands BDNF, EGF, and Glu bind to their respective receptors (TrkB, EGFR, mGluR) and start a signal transduction pathway starting with RAS and RAF1 which lead to the stimulation of MEK Then ERK. ERK promotes function of MSK1 (downstream kinase), ElK1 and CREB (Transcription Factors), and Caspases 3/7 (apoptotic molecules).

Host-pathogen interaction of human corona viruses - apoptosis	This pathway describes the induction and modulation of the apoptosis system during human coronavirus infection. The information is based on the review of Fung and Liu [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. Apoptosis is a highly controlled form of cell death that can be initiated by several internal (DNA damage) and external factors (T-cell death signal). There are some indications that induction of apoptosis in immune cells contribute to the suppression of the host immune system in some human coronavirus infections [10.1128/JVI.00269-12]. SARS-CoV induces caspase-dependent apoptosis by interfering with prosurvival BCL proteins (BCL2, BCL2L1, MCL1) and AKT1 and uses the apoptosis induced cell deconstruction it for replication, although it seems not to be depending on this mechanism for replication [10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.016].

Mammary gland development pathway - Puberty (Stage 2 of 4)	The primary mammary gland persists until puberty, when it grows and becomes branched. This results in the formation of secondary mammary gland.ESR1 and NRIP1 co-regulates PGR, STAT5A and AREG, which control proliferation and differentiation during mammary gland development. NRIP1 is also required for ductal elongation, in both epithelial and in stromal compartments [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23404106 1]. Estrogen may also execute its growth effect through EGF. Especially, ERBB2, an EGF receptor, may activate or inhibit the growth according to the stage of development. In puberty, ERBB2 impairs the mammary epithelial cell proliferation [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11146549 2]AP1 regulates postnatal mammary gland development, mainly in puberty. Some AP1-dependent genes are shown in the figure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678816 3]. FOSL1 is a FOS family member. FOS family members dimerize with JUN family members to form AP1 complex. MYC and CCND1 are associated with cell proliferation.

VEGFA-VEGFR2 Signaling Pathway	Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is central to a number of physiological conditions, from embryogenesis to wound healing in adults and is a hallmark of pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis [1-3]. Angiogenesis is mediated by the coordinated action of a variety of growth factors, metabolites and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells [4-6]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the principal angiogenic growth factor modulating neovascularization [7].The biological effect of VEGF is mediated through specific VEGF receptors on endothelial cell surface. VEGFs (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGF-D) interact with VEGF receptors such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. Among them, VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling appears to mediate cellular responses involved in angiogenesis prominently. Further, VEGF/VEGFR1 signaling, though weak, converges to VEGFR2 signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 at the surface of endothelial cells leads to dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2. It leads to activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation relevant to angiogenesis [8]. VEGFR2 dependent activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling regulates cell survival, cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic and cell permeability functions [9]. Another important pathway of VEGF mediated cell proliferation appears to be through PLCÎ³-mediated activation of PKC and downstream induction of the ERK and other PKC-dependent pathways [10]. Endothelial cell migration is induced by VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling through activation of p38MAPK (actin polymerization) and FAK (focal adhesion turnover) which is particularly important in directed migration. Phosphosite specificity towards downstream signalling has also been documented. Phosphosite mapping documented seven phosphosites in VEGFR2 receptor: Y1054, Y1214, Y801, Y1175, Y951, Y1059 and Y996. Phosphorylation of Y1214 and Y1054 regulates signaling events involved in cell migration. Y801 phosphorylation regulates cell survival. Y1175 regulates both cell proliferation and migration. Y951 and Y1059 phosphorylation regulates cell survival, cell migration and cell proliferation.VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network compiles data available in the literature with respect to VEGFA signaling (especially VEGFA-165) through VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The signaling events involving these proteins were derived from experimentally validated data involving multiple experimental techniques and approaches. Individual signaling events in VEGFR2 signaling networks leading to cell proliferation, migration and survival were identified and categorized into protein-protein interactions, enzyme-catalyzed events, activation/inhibition reactions, transport of protein across subcellular compartments, and gene regulation events. Signaling molecules involved in VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling were categorized to enzymes, receptors and transcription factors and the contextual activation/deactivation of these molecules downstream to VEGFA/ VEGFR2 signaling, in modulating angiogenesis, is documented.VEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map depicts the integration of signaling pathways regulating cell survival, cell migration, cell proliferation, cellular interactions downstream of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling relevant to angiogenesis, regulation of VEGFR2, phosphosite specificity of VEGFR2 towards downstream signaling, post-translational modifications, molecular function-based information, cross-talks among proteins in the canonical signaling modules and the information on the compartmentalization of proteins. The map of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network is interactive to help investigators to add new information as it becomes available in the future for analysis or representationVEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map may please be cited as:1.

Relationship between inflammation, COX-2 and EGFR	Arachidonic acid metabolic pathway can be activated by inflammation (stimulus). Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by a phospholipase A2 (PLA-2) enzyme and converted to bioactive PGE-2 by COX-2. PGE2 induced transactivation of the EGFR by triggering Src and PGE2, an important regulator of CYP19A1 gene expression, stimulates CYP19A1 activity to increase localized estrogen 17-beta-estradiol (E2). The E2 binds to the classical ER to promote its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it modulates the expression of estrogen target genes (COX-2). The interaction of E2 with ER-alpha also activates signaling cascades that promote cell proliferation, such as the activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase (Src). Src activation stimulates a matrix metalloproteinase cascade that culminates in liberating the EGF. The free EGF ligand binds to EGFR family receptors that activates ERK signaling cascade. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA) is a substrate for ERK and phosphorylation of cPLA (cPLAp), promoting its association with intracellular membranes such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria releasing lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid from these membranes. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into PGE-2. These key molecules and pathways that connect chronic inflammation with inflammation-associated oncogenic transformation could be targeted by drugs or natural products for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for malignant mesothelioma.

Nuclear Receptors	Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within the interior of cells that are responsible for sensing the presence of steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work in concert with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor's behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasisSource: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Nuclear_receptor]])Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP170 CPTAC Assay Portal]	NR4A1,RORA,RARA,NR2F2,NR1H3,THRB,THRA,NR0B1,PPARG,NR2F1,VDR,ROR1,PPARA,RXRB,NR1I2,AR,NR1H2,PPARD,NR1D2,NR1I3,NR5A1,ESR1,RORC,PGR,RARG,ESRRB,RXRG,NR3C1,NR2F6,NR4A2,RXRA,ESR2,HNF4A,ESRRA,RARB,NR5A2,NR2C2,NR2E1

For human coronaviruses it is presumed that coronaviruses stimulate the initiation of autophagy due to infection initiated stress for which PIK3R4 (VPS15), PIK3C3 (VPS34) and BECN1 (beclin1) are key proteins. Additionally, nsp6 (and nsp567 from other virus species than SARS-CoV) inhibit maturation of autolysosomes. Nsp6 is involved in the formation of double membrane vesicles and therefore has side effects on the formation of normal cellular vesicles [10.4161/auto.29309]. 	LC3,ATG13

FGF23 signalling in Hypophosphatemic rickets and related disorders	Hypophosphatemic rickets refers to a group of rare genetic disorders characterised by  clinical and radiographical features similar to rickets but caused by abnormalities in phosphate metabolism. The most common form, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH), is caused by inactivating mutations in the PHEX gene, which encodes the phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase PHEX.  Patients with XLH have elevated levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is thought to mediate many of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Elevated FGF23 levels have also been observed in other hypophosphatemic disorders, yet the role of FGF23 in the pathophysiology of these disorders is incompletely understood. This pathway illustrates hypophosphatemic and autocrine/paracrine molecular pathways that have been proposed to link FGF23 to the bone abnormalities observed in XLH and related disorders.

Acrylamide Biotransformation and Exposure Biomarkers	Acrylamide (AA) is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is converted to toxic glycidamide (GA) by cytochrome P450 2E1. Both AA and GA are coupled with glutathione (GSH) in the liver to form conjugates that are metabolized in the kidney and urinary tract to form modified merbapturic acids (AAMA and GAMA) that serve as biomarkers for AA in urine. Meanwhile, haemoglobin adducts are formed in the blood, including AA-Valine and GA-Valine. Genotoxic and carcinogenic activity is mediated by GA and the formation of DNA adducts with guanine and adenosine.   	CYP2E1
Fibrin Complement Receptor 3 Signaling Pathway	The blood protein fibrinogen, a key component of the coagulation cascade, has been identified as an early molecular factor triggering inflammation in the brain and periphery (see bibliography). Upon fibrinogen extravasation across leaky vessels (i.e., break down of the blood-brain barrier), fibrinogen is converted by thrombin to insoluble fibrin. Based on published studies, this signaling pathway highlights fibrin as a CD11b/CD18 (complement receptor; CR3) integrin receptor ligand that regulates innate immunity. Fibrin activates central nervous system (CNS) resident microglia and peripheral (bone marrow derived) macrophages via CR3, leading to intracellular kinase signaling activation including PI3K, AKT1 and RhoA activity that regulates phagocytosis; and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus that transcriptionally regulates proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit T-cells and macrophages.

TGF-B Signaling in Thyroid Cells for Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition	This pathway is based on the Figure 7 of "Cadherin 6 Is a New RUNX2 Target in TGF-β Signalling Pathway" (see bibliography). TGF-B is a target gene in thyroid cells in the causation of cancer. When TGF-B is activated, the pathway can take 2 directions, through a SMAD pathway or a Non-Smad pathway. Through the SMAD pathway, SMAD separates into SMAD2/3, SMAD4, and involves phosphates into the nuclear signalling. Through the Non-SMAD pathway, the activation of MAPK and Pi3k  causes the activation of ERK, AKT and phosphates, and then into the nuclear signalling. Within the nuclear signalling, EMT-TF has two responses, early and late. With the early response, EMT-TF signals to Id1 and RUNX2, and with the late response, EMT-TF signals to Snai1 and Snai2. Depending on the response also dictates the type of marker that will follow. If early, N-CAD,FN1,VIM,TNC, and CDH6 all cause the activation of the Mesenchymal markers. If late, E-CAD, and CDH16 cause the inhibition of the Epithelial Markers.

FGFR3 signalling in chondrocyte proliferation and terminal differentiation	Taken from Achondroplasia: Development, Pathenogenesis, and Therapy by Ornitz DM, Legeai-Mallet L [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27987249].Signaling pathways in the postnatal growth plateDuring endochondral bone development, FGF9 and FGF18, derived from the perichondrium and surrounding tissue, signal to FGFR3 in chondrocytes. The balance of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation is controlled by crosstalk of several signaling pathways. Expression of FGFR3 is enhanced by thyroid hormone (T3/3,3',5'-Triiodothyronine) and suppressed by PTHLH (member of the parathyroid hormone family). FGFR3 signaling results in increased expression of Snail1 (encoded by SNAI1), which is required for activation of STAT1 and MAPK signaling (ERK1/2 and p38 branches). Signaling from PTHLH, IHH and BMPs antagonizes the suppression of chondrocyte proliferation by FGFR3. Both FGFR3 and PTHLH function to suppress chondrocyte differentiation and antagonize the action of Wnt signaling, which promotes differentiation. FGFR3 negatively regulates the autophagy protein, ATG5. Activation of downstream signals: PP2a (encoded by PPP2CA) regulates p107 (encoded by RBL1) activation, and STAT1 regulates p21Waf1/Cip1 (encoded by CKDN1A) activation. Both function to suppress chondrocyte proliferation. Activation of the MAPKs, ERK1, and ERK2, regulate Sox9 expression, which functions to suppress chondrocyte terminal differentiation and endochondral ossification.Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.

Focal Adhesion	Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP306 CPTAC Assay Portal]	TXK,LAMC3,PDGFA,ITGA2,TNK2,BCL2,ERBB2,BIRC2,MYL5,BLK,CCND1,TNR,LAMC2,ELK1,FGR,PIK3CB,PARVA,BRAF,RELN,BCAR1,PTEN,SHC1,THBS2,RAC3,MAPK10,PTK2,ACTB,PAK2,Catnb,CRK,PIP5K1C,BAD,RAC2,DOCK1,EGFR,COL4A2,MYLPF,SHC3,PDGFRB,PARVB,RAC1,CAPN2,TESK2,ITGB5,VTN,LAMC1,SRC,FLNC,ITGB8,ITGA7,HGF,RAP1A,CDC42,VAV3,TNK1,PTK6,PDGFD,VASP,LAMB2,PDGFB,FLNA,SHC2,LAMB1,ITGAV,PRKCG,ROCK1,LAMA1,THBS1,CCND2,PRKCB,VAV2,STYK1,CAV3,VEGFC,ITGA1,LAMA3,ROCK2,ITGA2B,PARVG,HRAS,ARHGAP5,TNC,ACTN1,RAPGEF1,COL1A2,ZYX,PAK3,RHOA,VEGF,LAMB3,PPP1R12A,AKT1,MYL2,TNN,DIAPH1,ITGB3,ITGA9,TLN1,MYLK4,CCND3,PGF,LAMA4,PPP1CB,GRB2,MYLK2,PAK6,MAPK9,COL4A4,COL4A1,ITGB6,PAK4,FYN,PIK3CD,KDR,ARHGAP35,ITGA6,IGF1,PPP1R12B,ACTN4,CRKL,COL5A2,COL4A6,IBSP,COL2A1,SPP1,MYL12A,RASGRF1,BUB1B-PAK6,ITGA5,PXN,MAPK8,CHAD,JUN,TLN2,MYL9,FIGF,CAV1,XIAP,COL1A1,COL5A3,PDPK1,VAV1,PIK3R1,BIRC3,GSK3B,PIK3CA,ITGB4,ITGB7,LAMA5,ITGA11,MYL10,AKT2,SHC4,RAP1B,COL6A2,PRKCA,ITGA3,ITGB1,MYL12B,FLNB,THBS4,PPP1CA,MYLK3,ITGA8,LAMA2,RAF1,PDGFRA,FLT1,AKT3,CAV2,MYL7,PPP1CC,TNXB,IGF1R,EGF,ILK,SOS1,VWF,MAPK1,PIK3R3,PPP1R12C,SRMS,PDGFC,ACTG1,VCL,MAPK3,MET,HCK,PIK3R2,FN1,MAP2K1,COMP,THBS3,PAK1,MYLK,ITGA4,VEGFB,ITGA10
EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Resistance	Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are drugs that inhibit the phosphorylation, and subsequent activation, of tyrosine kinases. TKIs are typically used as cancer therapeutics, but development of resistance to TKIs in cancers is common. This pathway describes several mechanisms of TKI resistance in the context of EGFR signaling. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFR, is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that binds to the EGF-family of ligands. It activates several downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK, and leads to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Mutations and over-expression in EGFR is implicated in many cancers.The section of the pathway outlined in pink corresponds to mechanisms of TKI resistance.

Cancer immunotherapy by CTLA4 blockade	Immune checkpoints are hardwired into the immune system and are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks.CTLA-4 is expressed on T cells and is a negative regulator of T cell activation. CTLA4 counteracts the activity of the T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD28, which amplifies TCR signaling once antigen is bound. CTLA-4 and CD28 share the same ligands, CD80 and CD86, although CTLA-4 has a higher affinity. This is represented in the pathway with a blue inhibitory interaction.  One strategy for cancer immunotherapy is to block CTLA-4, thereby removing the negative regulation on T-cell activation. The first checkpoint antibody approved by the FDA was ipilimumab, approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma.

Autophagy	Autophagy is a type of process that cell allows itself to degrade intracellular components, including organelles, proteins and foreign bodies. Autophagy is inhibited by mTORC1 and activated by AMPK. The process requires four steps: initiation, formation, membrane expansion and maturation, which are characterised by the structures that are roughly represented by the structures that are present: the omegasome, phagophore, atophagosome and finally autolysosme. It requires formation of the autophagosome, a double-membrane structure filled with the isolated cytoplasmic material that the cell wants to remove. The autophagosome eventually fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome.

TSLP can also activate dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. TSLP not only activate the JAK/STAT pathway but also induce phosphorylation of other signaling molecules including PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and JNKs. Aberrant TSLP signaling is implicated in a number of the development of diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic eosophagitis and acute lymphoid leukemia.Description source: [http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_24 NetPath]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2203 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Cancer immunotherapy by PD-1 blockade	Immune checkpoints are hardwired into the immune system and are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks.One such immune checkpoint is PD-1 (programmed cell death 1 protein), which binds to its ligand PD-L1 and inhibits immune cell activity, including T cell activity. By upregulating PD-L1, cancer cells can inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack.

NLR Proteins	Mammalian cells have evolved a set of specialized pattern recognition-molecules (PRMs) to detect conserved molecular motifs present on pathogens known as pathogen associated-molecular-patterns (PAMPs). NLR proteins (alternatively named NBD-LRR or CATERPILLER) represent one subclass of PRMs that have recently attracted much attention. Their cytoplasmic location differs from the classical PRMs which are mostly membrane spanning receptors (such as the Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) or lectins) and accordingly NLRs were proposed to be activated mainly by intracellular bacterial pathogens.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR - VitD3 Signalling	Pathway representation of the model proposed by Ferreira et al. in the Figure 7 C of their article: "Proposed model for the mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in human-monocyte-derived DCs. We hypothesize that VDR-bound 1,25(OH)2D3 activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway via either forming a complex and phosphorylating the regulatory subunit of PI3K, or by other unknown mechanisms. This releases and activates the catalytic subunit, which unleashes the PI3K downstream pathway. Among other functions, activation of this pathway promotes the expression of different key glycolytic enzymes, which induces glycolysis. Control of surface marker expression and cytokine production by 1,25(OH)2D3 might arise from its impact on the PI3K pathway, which can control essential transcription factors (e.g., GSK-3ÃŽÂ² and NF-ÃŽÂºB nuclear translocation) or from the direct regulation of transcription factors, key metabolic bifunctional enzymes, and RNA binding proteins. In the absence of glucose or glycolysis, an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio will be sensed by AMPK, which, in turn, phosphorylates TSC2 and blocks activation of the mTOR complex and its downstream processes. We further consider that the increase in OXPHOS also seen in 1,25D3-DCs is derived from the excess pyruvate generated during induced glycolysis, in addition to the control of metabolic enzymes from the oxidative branch by 1,25(OH)2D3"Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4141 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PDHA1,p65,C-MYC,TSC1,IL10,PFKFB4,GSK-3b,CD86,AKT,IL12A,GLUT3,TSC2,mTOR ,CD80,LDHA,PI3K,CYP24A1,VDR,AMPK,RXR,HK3,HLA-DRA

CAMKK2  Pathway	CaMKK2 is a 66â€“68-kDa serine kinase, consists of unique N- and C-terminal domains and a central Ser/Thr-directed kinase domain that is followed by a regulatory domain composed of overlapping autoinhibitory and CaM-binding regions (PMID:9335539). CAMKK2 is activated once calmodulin (CALM1) binds with CAAMKK2. The most well-characterized substrates of CaMKK2 are CaMKI, CaMKIV and AMPKÎ±. CaMKK2 phosphorylates CaMKIV, CaMKI and AMPKÎ± on activation loop Thr residues (Thr-200, Thr-177 and Thr-172, respectively), which increases their kinase activities (PMID:9822657).

TGF-beta Signaling Pathway	The signal transduction mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological activities of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) have been extensively studied since its discovery nearly 30 years ago. TGF-β ligands belong to a large superfamily of cytokines that bears its name (TGF-β Superfamily) and includes bone morphogenic proteins, activins, inhibin, growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, and several other structurally-related polypeptides. Mammals express three TGF-β isoforms (i.e., TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) that are encoded by distinct genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. TGF-β was identified originally via its stimulation of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts; however, this cytokine is now recognized as being a potent tumor suppressor that prevents the dysregulated growth and survival of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In addition, numerous studies have clearly established TGF-β as a multifunctional cytokine that plays essential roles in regulating virtually all aspects of mammalian development and differentiation, and in maintaining mammalian tissue homeostasis. The pleiotropic nature of TGF-β is highlighted by the fact that every cell in the metazoan body can produce and respond to this cytokine. Even more remarkably, malignant cells have evolved a variety of complex mechanisms capable of circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-β, and in doing so, typically convert the functions of TGF-β to that of a tumor promoter, particularly the induction of carcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and dissemination to distant organ sites. This peculiar conversion in TGF-β function is known as the "TGF-β Paradox", which underlies the lethality of TGF-β in metastatic cancer cells. Thus, elucidating the effectors and signaling modules activated by TGF-β may offer new insights into the development of novel neoadjuvants capable of effectively targeting the TGF-β pathway to significantly improve the clinical course of patients with cancer, fibrosis, or immunologic disorders. TGF-β is secreted from cells as a latent homodimeric polypeptide that becomes tethered to the extracellular matrix by latent-TGF-β-binding proteins. Mature TGF-β isoforms are activated and liberated from extracellular matrix depots by a variety of mechanisms, including proteolysis, reactive oxygen species, changes in pH, and physical interactions with integrins, thromobspondin-1, or SPARC. Once activated, mature TGF-β initiates transmembrane signaling by binding to two distinct transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinases, termed TGF-β type I (TβR-I) and type II (TβR-II) receptors. In some cells and tissues, TGF-β also binds to a third cell surface receptor, TGF-β type III (TβR-III), which transfers TGF-β to TβR-II and TβR-I. Full activation of these cytokine:receptor ternary complexes transpires upon TβR-II-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of TβR-I, which then phosphorylates and activates the latent transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3. Afterward, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interact physically with Smad4, with the resulting heterotrimers translocating into the nucleus to regulate the expression of TGF-β-responsive genes. These Smad-dependent events are subject to fine-tuning and crosstalk regulation in the cytoplasm by their interaction with a variety of adapter molecules, including SARA, Hgs, PML and Dab2, and with Smad7, whose inhibitory activity is modulated by STRAP, AMSH2, and Arkadia; and in the nucleus by their interaction with a variety of transcriptional activators and repressors that occur in a gene- and cell-specific manner. In addition to activating canonical Smad2/3-dependent signaling, accumulating evidence clearly links the development of a variety of human pathologies to aberrant coupling of TGF-β to its noncanonical effector molecules. Included in this ever expanding list of noncanonical signaling molecules stimulated by TGF-β are PI3K, AKT, mTOR, integrins and focal adhesion kinase, and members of the MAP kinase (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK small GTP-binding proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, and Rac1).

Prostaglandin Synthesis and Regulation	A prostaglandin is any member of a group of lipid compounds that are derived enzymatically from fatty acids and have important functions in the animal body. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are mediators and have a variety of strong physiological effects, such as regulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue.[1] Prostaglandins are not hormones, but autocrine or paracrine, which are locally acting messenger molecules. They differ from hormones in that they are not produced at a discrete site but in many places throughout the human body.

TGF-beta Receptor Signaling	The Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

exRNA mechanism of action and biogenesis	The process of RNA-interference in eukaryotic cells. Long precursor microRNA (miRNA), called pri-miRNA, is cleaved by RNase III endonuclease (Drosha) into pieces of approximately 70 nucleotides each (called pre-miRNA) in the nucleus. Following transportation into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 another RNase III endonuclease (Dicer) cleaves it into mature miRNA segments. Degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and translational repression occurs after miRNA binds to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Cytoplasmic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved by Dicer into small interfering RNA (siRNA), which is incorporated into RISC, resulting in the cleavage and degradation of specific target mRNA. Synthetic double-stranded siRNA is not processed by Dicer and directly incorporated by the RISC.After cleavage by Dicer, mature miRNAs can also be released out of cells in exosomes, microvesicles or apoptotic bodies, or bond to some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and Argonaute protein 2 (Ago2). Viral miRNAs exported from the nucleus are processed in the same way.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2805 CPTAC Assay Portal]	DICER1,AGO2,ERI1,DGCR8,XPO5,Drosha
Mammalian disorder of sexual development	Multiple genes in the genital ridge are of importance for the formation of the bipotential ridge. Several of these genes are WT1, EMX2, PBX1, and CBX2. After 7 weeks there is a differentiation between XY and XX gonads.In the XX gonad, the absence of the gene SRY will result in the under expression of the SOX9 gene. This will have as a consequence that the SOX9 gene will not reach its threshold. Along with the expression of RSPO1 and WNT4, β-catenin is signalled and will lead to further inhibition of SOX9 and stimulation of FST and FOXL2. Both RSPO1 and WNT, as well as the combination of FST and FOXL2 are stimulated by NR5A1. This process will lead to the formation of the ovary due to the suppression of the formation of the testis, by inhibition of the genes. Due to the absence of androgens the female reproductive system can developIn the XY gonad the gene SRY is expressed in the pre-Sertoli cells leading to an upregulation of the SOX9 gene. In this upregulation NR5A1 has a promoting function to increase the SOX9 levels until it reaches its threshold level. once this level is reached a regulatory loop of FGF9 and PGD2 is activated to keep constant levels of SOX9. Another promoting factor of SOX9 is PGDS, this factor also stimulates the expression of SOX9. After the threshold levels are reached AMH is stimulated by SOX9. This stimulation is being catalysed by NR5A1, GATA4, WT1 and SOX8. AMH can then further stimulate AMHR2 and promote the regression of the Müllerian Ducts. AMH is possibly also involved in the suppression of genes involved in the formation of female structures, such as FOXL2 by DMRT1. When the Sertoli Cell is fully formed, it can induce the development of foetal Leydig cells via the DHH-pathway which produced INSL3. INSL3 is promoted by testosterone. Testosterone in itself is stimulated by NR5A1 and also stimulates the formation of 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The stimulation of DHT is catalysed by SRD5A1. These factors together induce the formation of internal and external male genitalia.

Prolactin Signaling Pathway	Prolactin (PRL), a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone, mostly secreted by the lactotrophic cells of anterior pituitary gland and to a lesser extent expressed in numerous extra pituitary tissues such as adipose tissue, lymphocytes, blood, plasma, skin fibroblasts, mammary epithelial cells, spleen, thymus, breast, prostate and sweat glands. Prolactin has been established to be present in all vertebrates and involved in more than 300 different effects, which can be ascribed to six broad categories: (i) reproduction and lactation, (ii) growth and development, (iii) endocrinology and metabolism, (iv) brain and behaviour, (v) immunomodulation and (vi) osmoregulation. Prolactin mediates its multiple functions through prolactin receptor (PRLR), a member of class I cytokine receptor superfamily. The PRLR comprises of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. PRLR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues such as brain, mammary epithelium, liver, cerebellum and lymphocytes. Prolactin has been shown to be involved in the progression of different forms of cancer such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Clinically, higher levels are found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Reiter's syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome. Besides 23 kDa full length PRL, a 16-kDa (16K PRL) N terminal fragment of prolactin produced by the cleavage by Cathepsin D has potent antiangiogenic and vasoconstrictive role in endothelial cells. In rat pulmonary fibroblasts cells 16K PRL is found to activate NF-kB pathway. Evidences also suggested that it has definite roles in programmed cell death in endothelial cells by activating various caspases. Prolactin associates with PRLR and induces the dimerization and activation of the receptor. The signaling reactions downstream of the long receptor isoform have been studied well and little is known about prolactin actions facilitated by short isoform. Since PRLR lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it initiates signal transduction through its associated kinases in the cytoplasmic tail. PRL signaling activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3- kinase), Src kinase and serine/threonine kinase Nek3-vav2-Rac1 pathways through the long isoform of the receptor. The prolactin signaling through short isoform can activate different downstream cascades except JAK/STAT pathway. JAK2 phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues of the receptor PRLR and enables the binding of downstream signaling molecules mainly signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. The STATs are considered as major effectors for PRL-dependent cell proliferation and gene activation, with STAT5 serving as the primary mediators. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimmerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of PRL-induced genes, activating gene transcription. Prolactin signaling also activates MAP kinase pathways and is reported to be involved in proliferation of normal and mammary tumor cells. Prolactin also stimulates PI-3K pathway and is reported that activation of PI-3K/AKT pathway initiates cell survival of lymphoid cells. Upon prolactin stimulation, the adapter protein GAB2 phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue recruits the catalytic subunit of PI-3K. Apart from these, prolactin also regulates cytoskeletal re-organization through the activation of Rac pathway. The Prolactin receptor dependent interactions of serine/threonine kinases NEK3 with guanine nucleotide exchange factors VAV1 and VAV2 and Tec with VAV1 regulate cytoskeleton remodeling.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/NetSlim_56 NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2037 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PRL,PPIB

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma pathway	Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors, Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanINs: https://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/professionals/DuctLesions.php). The overexpression of HER-2/neu (ERBB2) and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene (CDKN2A) at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumor suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway.The progression of disease and associated mutations is defined based on the arrow at the top, from left to right.

Glycerophospholipid Biosynthetic Pathway	Glycerophospholipids or phosphoglycerides, in which the hydrophobic regions are composed of two fatty acids joined to glycerol; and sphingolipids, in which a single fatty acid is joined to a fatty amine, sphingosine, are glycerol-based phospholipids and the main component of biological membranes. The hydrophilic moieties in these amphipathic compounds may be as a simple as a single -OH at one end of the sterol ring system, or they may be more complex. Glycerophospholipds, as well as sphingolipids, contained polar or charged alcohols at their polar ends; some also contain phosphate groups.In glycerophospholipids, two fatty acids are ester-linked to glycerol at C-1 and C-2, and a highly polar or charged (and therefore hydrophilic) head group is attached to C-3 through a phosphodiester bond. All glycerophospholipds are derivatives of phosphatidic acid and are named for their polar head groups (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine). All have a negative charge on the phosphate group at pH 7.0. The head-goup alcohol may also contribute one or more charges at pH near 7.0. The fatty acids in glycerophospholipds can be any of a wide variety. They are different in different species, in different tissues of the same species, and in different types of glycerophospholipids in the same cell or tissue. In general, glycerophospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid at C-2, and, in general terms, the fatty acyl groups are generally 16 or 18 carbons long.Eukaryotic membranes contain significant amounts of two other types of glycerophospholipids: Plasmalogens and Alkylacylglycerophospholipids. Plasmalogens contain a hydrocarbon chain linked to glycerol C-1 via vinyl ether linkage whereas alkylacylglycerophospholipids the alkyl substituent at glycerol C-1 is attached via an ether linkage. About 20% of mammalian glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens, this percentage varies both from species to species and from tissue to tissue within a given organism. While plasmalogens comprise only about 0.8% of the phospholipids in human liver, they account for around 23% of those in human nervous tissue. The alkylacylglycerophospholipids are less abundant than the plasmalogens, e.g., about 59% of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of human heart are plasmalogens, whereas only 3.6% are alkylacylglycerophospholipids. However, in bovine erythrocytes, 75% of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are of alkylacyl type.

Biotin Metabolism (including IEMs)	An important cofactor for carboxylation reaction is the vitamin Biotin. Four carboxylase groups (ACC, MCC, PCC and PC) are activated by binding to biotin and forming holocarboxylases, which in turn are responsible for several metabolic conversion in the Fatty Acid Synthesis, Leucine catabolism, propanoate metabolism and gluconeogenesis. Except for the ACC conversion from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA starting the fatty acid synthesis, all other three interactions are connected to disorders. Furthermore, one can distinguish two "multiple carboxylase defects" (MCDs), which are connected to the conversion of biocytin into biotin (BTD), or unbound biotin to one of the apocarboxylases (HCSD)This pathway was inspired by Chapter 14 (edition 4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).

The alternative pathway of fetal androgen synthesis	The development of sexual organs in humans is still not completely understood at the molecular level, controlled through the chromosomal difference between men and women. Steroids related to sexual development can have a temporary or permanent effects. Androgens are the leading compounds differentiating between (among other sexual organs) the internal and external genitalia of menNext to the classical pathway of androgen synthesis (see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4523]), alternative pathways are known, which make use of either selective expression patterns of isoenzymes or alternate enzymes. As an alternative, a socalled 'backdoor pathway', which can create dihydrotestosterone (DHT), skipping testosterone. Several enzymes between the classical and backdoor pathway are shared, however the later one utilises one unique enzyme, 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (gene: AKR1C2). Even though the relevance of this backdoor pathway for humans is not completely clear yet, mutations in the human AKR1C2 gene can lead to disordered sexual differentiation. This finding would indicate that both the classical and the alternative pathway are needed for normal development of male genitalia in humansFor more information on androgens, see Hiort (2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800242]), and for more information on the disease linked to this pathway, please visit Chapter 37 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).	17-beta-HSD,AKR1C4,3-beta-HSD,AKR1C2/4,P450scc,P450c17,5-alpha-reductase 1,17-beta-HSD3,STAR

Proteoglycan biosynthesis	PG synthesis is a complex mechanism that can be divided in four main steps. Core protein synthesis occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Once PG core protein has been synthesized, it moves from the RER to the Golgi apparatus where the first sugar of glycosaminoalycan (GAG) chain is added on Ser residues. GAG synthesis continues by glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar moieties from UDP-sugars to GAG chains. UDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are translocated in the Golgi apparatus by an antiporter with UMP. Then UDP, the by-product of glycosyltransferase reactions, is hydrolyzed to UMP and phosphate by calcium activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1). Chondroitin, dermatan and heparan sulfate synthesis starts on a Ser residue of the PG core protein with the formation of a tetrasaccharide linkage region composed of a xylose (Xyl), two galactoses (Gal) and a glucuronic acid (GlcUA). After tetrasaccharide synthesis, GAG chain elongation continues through the binding of specific saccharides defining chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Specific enzymes are involved in this process and mutations in their gene cause different types of skeletal dysplasia (indicated in red boxes). The third step is GAG sulfation.  Sulfate enters in cells through the SLC26A2 transporter and it is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by PAPS synthase (PAPSS) in the cytosol. Through a PAPS transporter (PAPST), PAPS moves to Golgi apparatus where it is used as sulfate donor by sulfotransferases to sulfate GAGs. This reaction also produces phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), that is hydrolyzed into AMP and phosphate by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP). Once synthesized, PGs are secreted in extracellular space.Sulfation of GAGs is an important step in PG synthesis determining PG properties. Inorganic sulfate enters in cells through a sulfate/chloride antiporter named SLC26A2, but a small amount of sulfate could be derived from sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. To be used by Golgi sulfotransferases, sulfate is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor, by PAPS synthase (PAPSS2).

TNF related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) Signaling Pathway	TNF related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a small pleiotropic cytokine of the TNF super family and its gene is located at chromosome 17p13.1. TWEAK has been reported to be expressed in tissues that include heart, brain, kidney and also in mononuclear blood cells. The multiple biological activities of TWEAK include stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and stimulation of apoptosis. It has been shown to be involved in the induction of cellular proliferation in liver cells, osteoblasts, astrocytes, synoviocytes, kidney cells and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, TWEAK plays a substantial role in cellular differentiation in osteoclasts. TWEAK induces glioma cell survival via imparting resistance to cytotoxic agents. It imparts its downstream signaling events by binding to its receptor, FGF inducible 14 protein (Fn14). Two modes of TWEAK-Fn14 (ligand-receptor) interactions have been proposed (i) the ligand dependent interaction which involves the higher concentration of homotrimeric TWEAK, that binds to low concentration of Fn14 in a heterohexameric complex (ii) ligand-independent interaction when the ligand concentration is lower than the receptor concentration which induces the ligand independent interaction. The receptors homotrimerize to activate the downstream events. The signaling cascades reported under TWEAK-Fn14 interactions are the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways and the MAPK pathway. There has been a report on crosstalk between Wnt and TWEAK pathways. In myoblasts the PI3K-AKT module has been reported to be inhibited under TWEAK stimulus. AKT phosprorylation leads to the activation of GSK3β resulting in increase of phospho-GSk3β and active β-catenin1 (CTNNB1) (dephosphorylated) levels. GSK3β and β-catenin1 remain associated in the cytoplasm, phosphorylation of GSK3β leads to the dissociation of β-catenin1 (dephosphorylated) resulting in the nuclear translocation of the protein. Despite of reports on TWEAK binding to other receptors including CD163 and DR3 the downstream events following the binding is yet to be established. The data provided by us would foster enormous avenues for further studies on TWEAK associated proteins and the related disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The data would enable therapeutic studies by selecting the pathological events and the simultaneous production of blocking agents. Despite the minimal amount of data, ours can also be used in the overlay of various high throughput data enabling pathway analysis and can be accessed by any pathway resource to generate a customized pathway.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tweak_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite Bhattacharjee2012 paper (see below).Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2036 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Osteoblast differentiation	Taken from:Building stronger bones: molecular regulation of the osteoblast lineage by Fanxin Long [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22189423]Osteoblast differentiation at a glance, Arkady Rutkovskiy, Kåre-Olav Stensløkken, Ingvar Jarle Vaage [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27667570]Development of the endochondral skeleton by Fanxin Long, David Ornitz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23284041].Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to 4 lineages by expressing corresponding transcriptional regulators: PPARg for adipogenic, MyoD for myogenic, Runx2 for osteoblastic, and Sox9 for chondrocytic lineages. In intramembranous ossification (osteogenesis in the scull and clavicles), preosteoblasts stem directly from mesenchymal stem cells, while in endochondral (osteogenesis of the axial skeleton and the limbs) a common osteo-chondro progenitor gives rise to both cell types.Extracellular signals regulating osteoblast differentiation: Model is based on studies of the mouse limb skeleton. Osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors (MP) through distinct developmental stages marked by expression of key transcription factors including SOX9, RUNX2, and OSX. Mature osteoblasts (OB) can further differentiate to osteocytes (OCY) or bone lining cells (not depicted) or undergo apoptosis (not depicted).Indian hedgehog (IHH) signaling is required for osteoblast differentiation during endochondral bone development. IHH binding to the receptor Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) activates signaling through Smoothened (SMO), thereby inhibiting the generation of the proteolytically cleaved GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) and promoting the generation of the full-length GLI2 activator (GLI2A). Whereas derepression of GLI3R is sufficient to generate RUNX2+ cells, both derepression of GLI3R and activation of GLI2A are necessary for progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage. NOTCH signaling inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Following binding to their ligands, Jagged (JAG) or Delta-like (DLL), Notch receptors are proteolytically cleaved by the g-secretase complex, leading to release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. NICD interacts with RBPJk and together they activate downstream target genes, including HES (Hairy and Enhancer of Split) and HEY (HES-related with YRPW motif) family transcription factors, ultimately leading to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, seemingly at a stage before OSX activation.WNT signaling promotes osteoblast differentiation. During b-catenin-dependent WNT signaling, b-catenin is stabilized following binding of WNT to its receptors Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6, leading to the transcription of b-catenin target genes and ultimately stimulating progression from the RUNX2+ stage to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage, and from RUNX2+OSX+ cells to mature osteoblasts. WNTcan also signal independently of LRP5/6 and b-catenin through protein kinase Cd (PKCd), promoting progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage through an unknown mechanism.Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling stimulates osteoblast differentiation and function. Binding of BMP2 or BMP4 to their receptors results in phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, or SMAD8. These can then form a complex with their partner, SMAD4, and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression, ultimately promoting the transition to RUNX2+OSX+ cells and enhancing the function of mature osteoblasts; however, a direct role for SMAD signaling in osteoblast differentiation remains to be shown.Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has diverse roles in osteoblast lineage cells. FGFs function by binding to cell surface Tyr kinase FGF receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4 in humans and mice), leading to the activation of multiple signaling modules. FGF signaling regulates preosteoblast proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, as well as the function of mature osteoblasts. However, the precise stages at which FGFs regulate proliferation and differentiation, and the intracellular signaling cascades responsible for each function, remain to be elucidated.

Initiation of transcription and translation elongation at the HIV-1 LTR	Following cellular activation or drug treatment, NFAT and NF-kB translocate to the nucleus and bind sites at the HIV-1 LTR. NFAT and NF-kB recruit p300/CBP to the LTR, resulting in acetylation of histone tails and transcriptional activation. In the case of NF-kB, proteosomal degradation of IkBa permits NF-kB translocation and displacement of the p50 homodimers. This is followed by Tat- dependent elongation in which Tat recruits the P-TEFb complex to TAR. Cdk9 phosphorylates the CTD of RNA Pol II, resulting in increased processivity. P-TEFb phosphorylates DSIF and NELF, resulting in removal of NELF from Pol II and converting DSIF into a positive elongation factor, thereby promoting productive elongation.Data nodes in blue represent HIV proteins.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3414 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PPP3CA,HDAC9,NFATC1,SUPT4H1,NELFB,Tat,CBP,HDAC8,PPP3R2,Ubiquitin,HEXIM1,PPP3CB,SP1,NFATC2,HDAC,RELA,HDAC2,RNA Pol II,PPP3CC,HDAC1,NFATC4,HDAC5,NFATC3,IKBA,SUPT5H,p300,Histones,NELFE,PPP3R1,CDK9,NELFA,HDAC3,CycT1,HDAC4,p50,NELFCD,HDAC7
Host-pathogen interaction of human corona viruses - MAPK signaling	This pathway describes the activation of the human MAPK signaling system during human coronavirus infection. The information is based on the review of Fung and Liu, Figure 7 [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. The MAPK signaling system is an important system to regulate response to different environmental stimuli, e.g. inflammation upon an infection. Their downstream effects include regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation and immune response. During corona virus infection three MAPK signaling pathways were studied and described. The p38 pathway (MAPK11 - 14) leads to stimulation of apoptosis via CHOP (DDIT3) while the ERK pathway (MAPK1 and MAPK3) counteracts apoptosis stimulation and supports cell survival by stimulation of ATF2 and FOS. The JNK pathway (MAPK 8-10) inhibits cell survival protein BCL2 thus stimulating apoptosis but also stimulating the AP1 complex that leads to the production of effectors to fight the infection. The interplay of apoptosis stimulation and cell survival is not yet fully understood in SARS-CoV infection.

Thyroxine (Thyroid Hormone) Production	Thyroxine hormone is produced in the thyroid gland from tyrosine and iodine. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced by the hypothalamus. It stimulates the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary gland, which affects the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Iodine is captured by a hydrogen peroxide trap procuced by thyroid peroxidase and added to the 3' and 5' postitions of tyrosine. This can either be free tyrosine or a tyrosine residue in thyroglobuline. After the multiple iodination steps this produces T3 and T4.The production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4),tri-iodothyronine (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) is dependent on the organification of iodine into thyroglobulin (Tg), the major protein product of the thyroid (2). This involves thyroid peroxidase catalyzed iodination of tyrosine residues in Tg to form mono- and di-iodotyrosines and their subsequent crosslinking to form the iodothyronines T3 and T4.Iodine 131 is an important radioactive fallout product. It was released in the atmosphere after nuclear tests and after nuclear incidents like at Tchernobyl and Fukushima. Since the iodine is concentrated in the thyroid glant as a substrate for the process described here non-radioactive iodine 127 is given as competitor to people exposed.

Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) signaling pathway	The Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is an anterior pituitary gonadotropin belonging to the family of glycoprotein hormones that includes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Leutinizing Hormone (LH) and Chorionic Gonadotropin. FSH controls the growth and maturation of follicles in the females and spermatogenesis in males. FSH is a heterodimer and shares a common alpha sub-unit with the other glycoprotein hormones in its family and has a specific beta subunit that confers receptor specificity and biological activity to the hormone. FSH acts through the FSH receptor (FSHR), a G protein coupled receptor  that is expressed exclusively on the granulosa cells of ovaries and Sertoli cells of the testis  in humans. FSH signaling involves activation of adenylyl cyclase activity and the increased production of cAMP. This activates the cAMP dependent protein kinases such as PKA, PKB and PKC that, in turn, lead to the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). In addition to activation of PI3K/Akt module, PKA also induces p38 mapk which, in turn, controls other kinase cascades. Activated Akt also induces the mTOR axis that stimulates mRNA translation by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and, consequently, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 that results in the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. It also indirectly aids in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs). FSH induces important genes required for steroidogenesis as well as growth and maturation of germ cells. The important target genes include aromatase (CYP19A1), the lutenizing hormone receptor (LHR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/fsh_pathway.html NetSlim] databaseIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper: Telikicherla, D., Ambekar, A., Palapetta, S.

Myometrial Relaxation and Contraction Pathways	This pathway illustrates signaling networks implicated in uterine muscle contraction at labor and quiescence throughout gestation (pregnancy). The muscle of the uterus, responsible for contractile activity is the myometrium. Genes in this pathway are either transcribed in myometrial muscle cells or act upon the myometrium to regulate contraction. The left half of this pathway illustrates pathways of myometrial relaxation that are active throughout normal gestation. These signaling events act to suppress coordinated contractions to prevent the early onset of labor at term, largely via activation of the adenylyl-cyclase thrhough G-protein coupled receptors. On the right side of this pathway are signaling componets involved in the activation of uterine contractions at labor, in particular, activation of calcium mobilization via Oxytocin mediated binding to the Oxytocin G-protein coupled receptor. Additional genes implicated in this pathway, based on microarray expression profiling of gestation, term and postpartum of term mice are also included (e.g., Guca2b, Rdc1, Edg2) have also been included.

For example, PAMAMs have been found to cause mitochondrial membrane destabilization, and silver and gold nanoparticles are reported to induce ER stress, which may lead to cytochrome c release from mitochondriaProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2507 CPTAC Assay Portal]	BAX,FLIP,FAS,FADD,BCL2,AIF,APAF-1,Perforin,SMAC/DIABLO,CASP8,CASP3,IAPs,CASP6,tBID,BAK,CASP7,Cyt C,FASLG,HTRA2/OMI,EndoG,CASP9,DNA
Complement Activation	The complement system is a biochemical cascade that helps, or complements, the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the immune system called the innate immune system that is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system. The Classical pathway of activation of the complement system is a group of blood proteins that mediate the specific antibody response. [source: Wikipedia]The Classical pathway begins with circulating C1Q binding to an antigen on the surface of a pathogen, which goes on to active and recruit 2 copies of each C1R and C1S, forming a C1 complex. The activated C1 complex cleaves C2 and C4. Activated cleavage products C2A and C4B combine to form  C3 convertase, which cleaves C3. The cleavage product C3B joins the complex to form C5 convertase, which cleaves C5. The cleavage product C5B joins C6, C7, C8 and multiple copies of C9 to form the Membrane Attack Complex, which forms a channel for water to flood into the target cell, leading to osmotic lysis. The Decay accelerating factor (DAF) inhibits C3 convertase.The Lectin pathway involves mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binding the surface of the pathogen instead of C1Q. MBL-associated serine proteases MASP1 and MASP1 can cleave C2 and C4 in place of the C1 complex, leading to the formation of C3 convertase and the subsequent cascade.The Alternative pathway relies on the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 and the cleavage of factor B (CFB) by factor D (CFD), which form an alternative C3 convertase stabilized by factor P (CFP). Additional copies of the cleavage product C3B are recruited to the complex, resulting in an alternative C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 and contributes C5B to the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP545 CPTAC Assay Portal]	C1QB,C8B,C7,C3,C3B,C5,CFBb,C1QA,C5B,C2,C8G,C2A,CFP,C1S,C4A,C1QG,C8A,MASP1,C9,C1R,CFD,CFB,MASP2,C4B,DAF,C6
Vitamin B6-dependent and responsive disorders	Vitamine B6 is absorbed in different vitamers, which undergo several (de)phosphorylation steps, to be able to pas the blood-brain barrier. Within the brain, PLP (Pyridoxal-P) is the only active cofactor for intracellular enzyme reactions. PLP catalyses over 100 reactions, mainly related to amino acids and neurotransmitter metabolism. Bold lines in the Figure show how the major source of PLP is divided in the bodyA number of genetic defects have been identified as the underlying cause of vitamine B6 dependent epilepsies, particularly occurring in the neonatal life stage, which could lead to irreversible brain damage or could be fatal.The disorders related to this pathway can be divided in two categories: reduced production/availability of PLP or inactivation of PLP by formation of Knoevenagel productsSpecific biomarkers from urine, plasma or Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) exist to distinguish the disordersOral treatment with PL or PLP is available, as well as intrauterine treatment with vitamine B6 for mothers in the early stages of pregnancy.This pathway was inspired by Chapter 11 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).

Wnt Signaling Pathway	WNT signal, through the canonical pathway, controls cell fate determination and through the non-canonical pathway controls cell movement and tissue polarity. The name "wnt" is a fusion of two terms, wg derived from the Drosophila gene wingless (wg) and int derived from the proto-oncogene integration-1, which is the mammalian homolog of wg. ÃŸ-catenin is the key regulated effector of Wnt, involved in canonical signaling . Free ÃŸ-catenin is bound by a multiprotein "destruction complex". The ÃŸ-catenin destruction complex is comprised of ÃŸ-catenin, scaffold proteins (APC, AXIN) and serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate ÃŸ-catenin casein kinase 1 (CSNK1A1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK1G1) and GSK3B. The sequential phosphorylation of ÃŸ-catenin by casein kinase 1 and GSK3 is recognised by an SCF-class E3-ubiquitin ligase, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteosomal destruction. Canonical WNT signals are transduced through a two-part receptor, a seven-transmembrane Frizzled (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/LRP6) to a ÃŸ-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling cascade. On recruitment of deshevelled (DVL1) to FZD and AXIN to LRP6, ÃŸ-catenin destruction complex disassembles leading to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear ÃŸ-catenin binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and Legless family docking protein, BCL9. These activate the transcription of Wnt target genes CCND1, MYC. Non-canonical WNT signaling diverges downstream after being transduced through FZD family receptors and co-receptors, ROR2 and RYK. This pathway does not involve ÃŸ-catenin-mediated gene expression. Small G proteins such as RAC1, RHOA and downstream effectors of RAC including JNK are DVL-dependant effector molecules of the non-canonical pathway. These have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement, dendrite growth and control of cell polarity and orientation. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) are Ca2+-dependant effectors of the non-canonical pathway. NLK inhibits canonical pathway by phosphorylation of TCF/LEF family transcription factors. NFAT transcription factor is implicated in convergent extension during early embryogenesis and carcinogenic metastasis Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/wnt_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Kynurenine Pathway and links to Cellular Senescence	The kynurenine pathway is the major path for Tryptophan (Trp) breakdown (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020; Kondrikov et al., 2020; Li, Oxenkrug &amp; Yang, 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan &amp; Guillemin, 2019). The kynurenine (Kyn)/Trp ratio is proposed to be an accurate indicator of biological age as well as an indicator of risk for age-related diseases (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020;  Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019).The first and also rate-limiting enzymes that determine rate of Trp conversion into N-formylkynurenine and further on into Kyn are tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), out of which the IDO isoform IDO1 is the most important (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020;  Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Minhas et al., 2018; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan &amp; Guillemin, 2019). This catalytic enzyme is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, interferons gamma and beta or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020; Kondrikov et al., 2020; Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan &amp; Guillemin, 2019).Next, N-formylkynurenine is converted either into kynurenic acid by a kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), anthranilic acid by kynureninase or, into Kyn by formidase (AFMID) (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020). Kyn can alter the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation and induce oxidative stress through by inducing the transcription of multiple miRNAs (Dalton et al., 2020),  activating the p53/p21 pathway (Kondrikov et al., 2020) and  binding to AhR, resulting in a positive feedback loop, while further promoting oxidative stress (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, Dalton et al., 2020; 2020, Kondrikov et al., 2020).Kyn is further converted into 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) by kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), then Kynureninase converts 3HK into 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) and then into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (ACMSA) (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020, Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Tan &amp; Guillemin, 2019). 3-HK can alternatively be converted into xanthurenic acid, a metabolite that modulates the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway,(Tan &amp; Guillemin, 2019). 3HAA can be converted either into quinolinic acid and from there enter the de novo NAD synthesis due to the enzymatic action of nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase (QPRT), or it can be converted into 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde (AMSA) which can be converted into glutaryl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle and glycolysis (Castro-Portuguez &amp; Sutphin, 2020; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Tan &amp; Guillemin, 2019).

Nanomaterial-induced Inflammasome Activation	This is a schematic diagram illustrating putative pathways for NAMP (nanomaterial-associated molecular patters)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) eg. lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the cell membrane, which leads to NF-κB activation and upregulation of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and NLRP3 expression. High aspect radio nanomaterials (i.e. long multiwalled carbon nanotubes) are thought to trigger “frustrated phagocytosis” in macrophages, leading to NADPH oxidase activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammasome activation. Smaller nanomaterials (i.e. short carbon nanotubes or silver nanoparticles of 28 nm), on the other hand, could be phagocytosed and once inside the cell induce lysosomal damage leading to release of cathepsins which cause mitochondrial damage and ROS production. In both cases, interaction of phagocytes with NAMPs induces an overproduction of ROS which results in assembly of NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and pro-caspase-1 into the multimeric inflammasome complex, resulting in activation of caspase-1, and release of mature IL-1β, a key pro-inflammatory mediator.

Nuclear Receptors Meta-Pathway	In the field of molecular biology, nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand is present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression.A unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. As a consequence, nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. As discussed below, nuclear receptors may be classified according to either mechanism or homology[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]	ABCC5,SLC39A8,CYP3A4,MYOF,SLC2A12,SLC5A11,PTGS2,PCK1,ENC1,SLC39A7,NR1I3,DNAJC15,THBD,HGF,SLCO2B1,IL11,AKAP13,GPX3,GCC1,SLC39A14,EPHA2,NFKB2,RGS2,PGD,SLC6A7,IL1B,ALOX5AP,ALAS1,AHR,SLC6A4,GPAM,SLC6A17,HSPA1A,GPX2,BLVRB,GSTM3,SLC27A1,NCOA2,GSTA3,SLC39A13,TXNRD3,SLC10A1,FASN,SLC6A9,GSTM1,GSTM5,DBI,S100P,SLC39A10,DNAJC7,NFE2L2,IL12A,EGR1,NRIP1,TNS4,MGAM,FKBP5,BIRC2,MGST3,ABCB1,SLC6A8,UGT2B4,HBEGF,EGFR,UGT1A3,KAT2B,SERPINB9,EDN2,ANKRD1,ACAA1,SRC,TGFB1,SLC2A14,UGT1A9,CES5A,CPT1A,SLC6A14,BAAT,PRRG4,CYP1A1,FTH1,SLC2A4,KEAP1,ZIC2,SLC6A16,SLC39A3,FABP1,SRC&#xA;&#xA;,CYP3A7,SRC&#xA;,KLK15,CAP2,KTN1,SLC2A1,SLC6A11,IL12B,UGT1A7,SLC39A2,SLC5A8,CDKN1B,GSTA2,CYP1A2,SLC6A20,PTGES3,p23,HES1,SLC2A11,ABCG8,SLC2A8,SMARCA1,SCP2,GSR,HMOX1,BAX&#xA;,AIP,CDC37,PLK2,CBR3,ACADM,UGT1A4,PLTP,UGT1A1,CCL20,NCOA3,SLC7A11,SLC2A7,HSP90AA1&#xA;,SRPX2,SQSTM1,NR1H4,MAFG,PPP1R14C,UGT2B7,ABCB11,SDPR,B3GNT5,FGF13,NCOA6,ACOX1,SLC6A3,TGFB2,CBR1,ETNK2,BHLHE40,PTGR1,JUN,PDK4,FTL,JUNB,MFGE8,SLC39A11,GSTA4,ABCC3,SPINK13,SREBF1,TSC22D3,IFNG,NAV3,PRDX6,ANGPTL4,SRGN,SLC5A6,SLC6A13,SLC2A3,GSTP1,SLC6A1,SLC6A6,CPT2,TXN,HSP90AA1,EP300,MGST2,GSTA5,SEC14L1,APOC3,SLC39A4,CES2,PDGFB,GCLM,CES1,SP1,NR3C1,DNER,SLC26A2,MT1IP,GCLC,SRXN1,HSP90AB1,EPHA3,CYP4F12,ABCC4,GSTT1,SERPINA1,SCD,SCNN1A,NRG1,CYP1B1,LRRC8A,IGFBP1&#xA;&#xA;,VDR,CCND1,ABCC2,SLC2A5,CYP2A6,SLC6A2,EPB41L4B,NR0B2,ME1,CPEB4,CXCR7,CDK4,PMP2,SLC5A4,SERTAD2,GGT1,SLC39A12,TGFBR2,SLC39A9,DNAJB1,FGF19,GPR153,SLC6A19,CYP7A1,CYP2B6,SLC2A13,AGER,CES3,SNAI2,G6PD,TGFA,SLC5A2,CES4A,SLC2A2,SLC5A5,CDC42EP3,SMC1A,PPARGC1A,PDE4B,ESR1,SLCO1B1,SLC5A3,APOA2,ALDH3A1,NCOA1,GSTA1,SLC6A15,FGFBP1,APOA5,GSTM2,PPP2R4,SLC19A2,CUL1,IRS2,IL17B,GSTT2,PRDX1,CCL2,NR1H3,MGST1,GPR115,BIRC3,UGT1A6,PPARD,SLC27A5,SLC39A5,CYP2C9,POU5F1,SLC6A5,ARNT,SULT1A1,CYP2C19,PSMC5,SLC5A1,SPRY1,SLC5A12,ARL5B,AHRR,FOXO1,CYP4A11,SOD3,IP6K3,CYP3A5,GSTM4,ABCG5,TNF&#xA;&#xA;,ABHD2,SLC6A18,POLK,SLC2A9,MYC,SLC39A6,TXNRD1,TGFBR3,SLC39A1,SLC2A6,AMIGO2,NR1I2,SERPINB2,GADD45B,SULT2A1,PPARA,NQO1,JUND,SLC7A5,RXRA,STAT3,SLC5A10,MAFF,IL2&#xA;&#xA;,CDKN1C,STOM,EHHADH,TNFAIP3,CYP8B1,APOA1,ABCB4,ADH7,SLC5A7,CDK1,FGD4,SLC2A10,SLC5A9

IL-5 Signaling Pathway	Interleukin 5 (IL-5) ligand belongs to the cytokine superfamily. IL-5 is a glycoprotein which belongs to the cytokine superfamily. It possesses the four helical bundle motifs that is conserved among several hematopoietic cytokines. IL-5 plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils. IL-5 induces terminal maturation of eosinophils, prolongs eosinophils survival by delaying apoptotic death, increases eosinophils adhesion to endothelial cells and enhances eosinophils effector function. IL-5 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma, hypereosinophilic syndromes and eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases. IL-5 is produced by eosinophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, Tc2 cells and gamma delta T cells. IL-5 exerts influence on different biological activities by associating with the IL-5 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex consisting of an alpha chain-IL5RA and a beta chain, CSF2RB, which is shared between IL-5 receptor, IL-3 receptor and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor. Binding of IL-5 to the receptor complex results in the recruitment of adapter proteins including SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1. This leads to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Subsequent activation of transcription factors including JUN and ELK-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. IL-5 stimulation also resulted in the activation of PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathway resulting in the phosphorylation of RPS6 and regulation of gene expression. JAK phosphorylation and activation is also brought about by IL-5, which in turn results in the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins. The STAT transcription factors are responsible for the expression of early response genes and feedback inhibitor of JAK/STAT pathway. In addition, IL-5 is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, BTK and SYK.

Energy Metabolism	"The PPARGC1A protein is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism. This protein interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARG, which permits the interaction of this protein with multiple transcription factors. This protein can interact with, and regulate the activities of, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs). It provides a direct link between external physiological stimuli and the regulation of mitochondrial  biogenesis, and is a major factor that regulates muscle fiber type determination.

Oncostatin M Signaling Pathway	Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in cell types such as activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and in microglial cells. OSM signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor [1]. The major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways [2-5]. As the receptors lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) [1, 6-8]. Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside nucleus STAT proteins bind to regulatory elements in the promoter of OSM-responsive genes and regulate the gene expression [1-3, 8]. Alternatively, OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11, GRB2, SHC1, Ras/Raf molecules can bring about the activation of ERK1/2 signaling module [1]. Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2 signaling module induces the phosphorylation of CEBPB, both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism [9]. Although OSM also causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family members (MAPK8/9/14) the functional importance of this is at present not well understood [1, 11]. OSM mediated signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition by SOCS3 and STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3 [4-5, 10].OSM also induced the activation of caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2 module and regulates apoptosis [12-14]. In osteosarcoma cells OSM is found to mediate apoptosis through a less understood STAT5B signaling module [14]. 1.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mediated LDL receptor degradation	Exogenously, circulating PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) protein binds to LDLR (LDL receptor). Once internalized into the liver cell, the PCSK9 protein directs the LDLR to the lysosome for degradation. Intrinsically, PCSK9, which is secreted from the Golgi apparatus, binds the LDLR before it reaches the cell surface, leading it to lysosomal degradation. However, the precise mechanisms by which the intrinsic degradation pathway operates are still unknown. Abbreviations: LDLR, LDL receptor; PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.

Sulfation Biotransformation Reaction	Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule that can be excreted more easilySulfation is a phase II biotransformation reaction in which sulfate acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the catalysis of sulfotransferases. Sulfate is first combined with ATP molecules to form PAPS via the dual function enzymes PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 consisting of a sulfurylase domain and an APS kinase domain. From PAPS the sulfate group is transferred to the actual substrate via the action of sulfotransferases, resulting in a sulfated substrate and the sulfate-lacking PAP.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP692 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Pyrimidine metabolism	Pyrimidines are nucleic acids and the products of pyrimidine degradation are water-soluble. The pyrimidine ring is synthesized before it is conjugated to PRPP. The first reaction is the conjugation of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate to make N-carbamoylaspartate. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase used in pyrimidine biosynthesis is located in the cytoplasm. The enzyme that carries out the reaction is aspartate transcarbamoylase, an enzyme that is closely regulated. The second reaction is ring closure to form dihydroorotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotase. This circular product contains a 6-membered ring with nitrogen and carbons located in the same positions as in the mature pyrimidine ring. The third reaction is the oxidation of the ring to form a carbon- carbon bond. The reducing equivalents are transferred to a flavin cofactor of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The product is orotic acid. Fourth, the orotate ring is transferred to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form a 5-ribose-phosphate, orotidylic acid. Finally orotidylate is decarboxylated to yield UMP, which of course contains one of the bases of RNA. Cellular kinases convert UMP to UTP. Transfer of an amido nitrogen from glutamine by CTP synthetase converts UTP to CTP; this reaction uses an ATP high-energy phosphate. Pyrimidine synthesis is controlled at the first committed step. ATP stimulates the aspartate transcarbamoylase reaction, while CTP inhibits it. CTP is a feedback inhibitor of the pathway, and ATP is a feed-forward activator. This regulation ensures that a balanced supply of purines and pyrimidines exists for RNA and synthesisEukaryotic organisms contain a multifunctional enzyme with carbamoylphosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase activities. Two mechanisms control this enzyme. First, control at the level of enzyme synthesis exists; the transcription of the gene for the enzyme is reduced if an excess of pyrimidines is present. Secondly, control exists at the level of feedback inhibition by pyrimidine nucleotides. This enzyme is also an example of the phenomenon of metabolic channeling: aspartate, ammonia, and carbon dioxide enter the enzyme and come out as orotic acidDescription text is based on [https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/biology/biochemistry-ii/purines-and-pyrimidines/pyrimidine-metabolism Cliff's Notes].Pathway is based on [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map00240 KEGG]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4022 CPTAC Assay Portal]	POLR2J1,UCK2,ENTPD8,ENTPD6,NME6,UCK1,POLR2G,DUT,POLR1C,NT5C,POLR3GL,POLR2E,NME4,PRIM1,TK1,NT5E,TYMS,ENTPD4,DTYMK,POLR2J2,UCKL1,CDA,POLA1,POLR2K,DHODH,POLR3D,POLD2,CMPK1,TWISTNB,PRIM2,POLD3,POLR3E,POLR2C,RRM1,NME1-NME2,POLR1B,POLR1E,RRM2B,DPYS,POLR2H,DPYD,RRM2,DCK,DCTD,POLR2J3,POLR2L,POLR1D,POLD4,PNP,POLR2A,ZNRD1,ENTPD1,TYMP,POLR2B,CANT1,PNPT1,CAD,POLR3F,UPB1,CTPS1,UMPS,UPP2,POLE4,NME1,POLR3A,DCTPP1,AK9,POLA2,POLR2I,CTPS2,POLR3G,NUDT2,ENPP1,POLE2,ENTPD5,POLR3B,NME7,NT5M,POLR3C,ENTPD3,POLR1A,ENPP3,NME,POLE3,NME3,CMPK2,NME2,UPP1,TK2,POLE1,UPRT,POLR3K,POLD1,POLR2D,POLR3H
Urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups	The urea cycle (also known as the ornithine cycle) is a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea ((NH2)2CO) from ammonia (NH3). This cycle occurs in ureotelic organisms. The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion. This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered (Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit, 1932), five years before the discovery of the TCA cycle. The urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys.Amino acid catabolism results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic organisms, or ammonotelic organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it. Ammonia is toxic, but upon excretion from aquatic species, it is diluted by the water outside the organism. Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove nitrogen as ammonia convert it to a less toxic substance such as urea or uric acid. The urea cycle mainly occurs in the liver. The urea produced by the liver is then released into the bloodstream where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. In species including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its urate salt, which is excreted in solid formSource description: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP497 CPTAC Assay Portal].	3.5.1.5
Signal transduction through IL1R	Signal transduction through IL1RPathway based on Biocarta pathway (M12095)https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_il1rPathwayIL-1 signals primarily through the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1). Through expression of cytokines such as TNF, TGF-beta and interferons, IL-1 holds a range of inflammatory activities that include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules and roles in arthritis and septic shock. IL-1 binds to the respective IL-1 receptor however, it requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) to transduce a signal. Two kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-2) get activated through IL-1 binding to its receptor. Via these kinases a cascade gets activated which includes TRAF6, NF-kB activation and c-JUN activation. The IL-1 signaling cascade represents a highly conserved response to pathogens.

Type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common form of kidney cancer in adults, is not a single disease but rather a collection of different tumor types driven by distinct genetic changes that arise within the same tissue. Papillary RCC represents 15 to 20 percent of RCC diagnoses and can manifest as an aggressive, solitary tumor or as multiple, slow-growing tumors. Papillary RCC itself has two main subtypes, type 1 and type 2, that are distinguished histologically. Little is currently known about the genetic basis of non-hereditary papillary RCC and patients receive treatment simply based on disease stage. If caught early, the disease can usually be cured surgically.

FTO Obesity Variant Mechanism	Mechanism underlying the association of FTO locus variants and obesity. The wild type T allele at rs1421085 in the FTO locus comprises a protein-DNA binding motif for ARID5B that represses the transcription of IRX3 and IRX5, which in turn de-represses a set of thermogenic genes, leading to mitochondrial thermogenesis and a browning adipocyte program. The C risk allele, on the other hand, disrupts the binding motif for ARID5B and activates a mesenchymal superenhancer and its targets, IRX3 and IRX5, which represses thermogenesis and leads to a shift to lipid storage, white adipocytes and, thus, increased risk of obesity.In addition to the primary literature references associated with the pathway, also refer to this blog article providing additional perspective and drug discovery potential by Roger Plenge, "Article of the week: ARID5B-FTO-IRX3/IRX5 regulatory axis for drug discovery in obesity (NEJM)."

mRNA Processing	This process describes the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA (mRNA).The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.5' Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.3' Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.Splicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of tetracosanoyl-CoA		
Pathways in clear cell renal cell carcinoma	Inactivation of VHL due to mutation or DNA methylation is an early event in ccRCC that leads to accumulation of the transcription factor HIF-α, which dimerizes with HIF-β and translocates to the nucleus. The resulting HIF-α–HIF-β-induced up-regulation of downstream genes promotes cell proliferation, glucose uptake, glycolysis, and angiogenesis. Mutations in chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers including PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1 and KDM5C lead to global abnormal gene expression patterns, and deficiency in DNA repair, which contributes to genomic instability. Activation of PI3K–mTOR signaling promotes cell proliferation and tumor aggression, and increases translation of HIF-α, leading to enhanced HIF-α-mediated gene expression. The proposed development pattern of ccRCC is based on tumor evolution analyses and current understanding of genomic variation.Description adapted from "Precision medicine from the renal cancer genome", Riazalhosseini and Lathrop.Additional sources of information:mTORC1 complex is based on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanistic_target_of_rapamycin#mTORC1 Wikipedia].

BMP Signaling Pathway in Eyelid Development	The signaling pathways involved in eyelid development are displayed with interactions that are known (solid arrows) and proposed (dotted arrows). The four main pathways shown are activated by Fgf10 and regulate key processes, but also interact with each other. The first pathway is a proposed promotion of sfrp1 which inhibits Wnt that regulates the Meibomian Gland. The Wnt pathway also activates pitx2 and begins the proposed pathway to eyelid closure. The second pathway begins with Fgfr2 activating Bmp4, a protein that may also be regulated by Shh, and continuing through a protein chain to regulate conjunctival cell fate. In this pathway Bmp also inhibits transdifferentiation of Meibomian Gland into a hair follicle, conjunctiva proliferation, and precocious differentiation. The last two pathways are linked to the regulation of eyelid closure through a cascade of protein activation and is further promoted by Bmp through stimulation of phosphorylated c-Jun.

Non-homologous end joining	Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as "non-homologous" because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homologous recombination, which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)-XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation.NHEJ typically utilizes short homologous DNA sequences called microhomologies to guide repair. These microhomologies are often present in single-stranded overhangs on the ends of double-strand breaks. When the overhangs are perfectly compatible, NHEJ usually repairs the break accurately. Imprecise repair leading to loss of nucleotides can also occur, but is much more common when the overhangs are not compatible. Inappropriate NHEJ can lead to translocations and telomere fusion, hallmarks of tumor cells. NHEJ is evolutionarily conserved throughout all kingdoms of life and is the predominant double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells.Adapted from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining Wikipedia], [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03450 KEGG] and [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/8/ REPAIRtoire].This pathway is part the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP438 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Direct Reversal Repair	Direct reversal repair is a mechanism of repair where the damaged area or lesion is repaired directly by specialized proteins. It does not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone and doesn't require a reference template unlike the other single-strand repair mechanism.  Methylation of guanine bases is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT). This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once. Methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine  is repaired by ALKBH2 and ALKBH3.This pathway is based on information from [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/4/ REPAIRtoire] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair Wikipedia].

TCA Cycle (aka Krebs or citric acid cycle)	The [[wikipedia:citric_acid_cycle|citric acid cycle]], also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) or the Krebs cycle, (or rarely, the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle) is a series of enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions of central importance in all living cells that use oxygen as part of cellular respiration. In eukaryotes, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. The components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established by seminal work from both [[wikipedia:Albert_Szent-Gyorgyi|Albert Szent-Gyorgyi]] and [[wikipedia:Hans_Krebs|Hans Krebs]].Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:citric_acid_cycle]])Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP78 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Aripiprazole Metabolic Pathway	The CYP P450 metabolism of aripiprazole has been studied and described in several papers (like the one in the bibliography), except for the original primary literature describing the experiments and the exact metabolite structures. The two CYPs are said to be involved in N-dealkylation and dehydrogenation. 	CYP3A43,CYP2D6
SCFA and skeletal muscle substrate metabolism	The short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate and butyrate can alter skeletal muscle metabolism both via direct and indirect mechanisms. Indirect mechanisms include the stimulation of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) release via G-protein coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) and GPR43 signalling. Increased peripheral levels of these gut-derived satiety hormones induce the recruitment of microvasculature in skeletal muscle tissue and thereby contribute to improved insulin signalling. Furthermore SCFA induce a reduction in lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT), resulting in enhanced WAT lipid buffering capacity and decreased levels ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue. SCFA are also suggested to have direct effects on skeletal muscle metabolism, possibly via GPR41 and GPR43 signalling. SCFA  induce the activation of  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator in skeletal muscle cell metabolism. Activated AMPK induces several metabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation and the synthesis of glycogen. Active AMPK also stimulates glucose uptake via translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and decreases glycolysis. In addition to AMPK activation, SCFA might also induce peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARD) expression, another process contributing to enhanced fat oxidation levels.

Catalytic cycle of mammalian Flavin-containing MonoOxygenases (FMOs)	Flavin-containing monooxygenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of substrates, mostly soft nucleophiles via the cofactor flavin. In the catalytic cycle, FMO binds to NADPH and to FAD, causing the reduction of FAD to FADH2. Next, molecular oxygen binds to the complex and is reduced to a hydroperoxide form, called 4a-hydroperoxyflavin. This complex is stable in the absence of a substrate. When a substrate is present, the distal O-atom of the complex is transferred to the substrate yielding an oxygenated product and leaving the flavincomplex 4a-hydroxyflavin that breaks down releasing water. At the end of the cycle, NADP+ is released resulting in FAD as the flavin form to start a next cycle. In contrast to cytochrome P450 enzymes, FMOs are generally not induced or inhibited by xenobiotic substances. The five human FMOs are tissue specific: FMO1 is present in the human fetal liver and the adult kidney, FMO2 is present in the lung and FMO3 is present in the adult liver.	FMO4,FMO5,FMO1,FMO2,FMO3
Nanoparticle triggered regulated necrosis	Programmed cell death: regulated necrosis. During regulated necrosis, different stimuli are recognized or sensed by specific receptors on the cell surface or inside cells. The activation of the necrosome stimulates different signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial hyperpolarization, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cellular disintegration.

MAPK Signaling Pathway	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.Description reference: KEGG http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04010Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP382 CPTAC Assay Portal]	CACNG6,PPP5D1,MRAS,CACNG4,CACNA1C,FGF21,CACNG2,MAPK11,GNA12,RRAS2,CD14,FGF13,JUND,TGFB2,MAP3K11,GRB2,MAPK12,FGF3,PRKACG,MYC,TAB1,MAP2K6,MAPK9,PPP5C,MAPK8IP1,DDIT3,PTPRR,ATF2,BDNF,CACNA1S,CACNA1G,PPM1A,NRAS,CACNG7,MAP4K4,CHUK,DUSP3,CACNA2D1,CACNB3,MAPT,NTF3,DUSP6,NGF,CRKL,CACNG1,CACNA1A,FAS,RASGRF1,MAPK8,TAB2,FGFR3,JUN,HSPA1B,FGF6,FGF14,FGF23,FGF10,RPS6KA3,ECSIT,MAP2K4,PLA2G4A,MAP4K1,FGF11,CACNG5,PRKACA,CACNA2D2,MAPKAPK5,SOS2,TAOK2,FGF4,CACNA1H,PPP3CB,FGFR4,RASA2,CACNA1D,AKT2,RAP1B,MEF2C,PRKCA,PPP3CA,FLNB,FGF17,DUSP2,MAP4K2,TGFBR1,GADD45A,FGF5,FGF22,FGFR1,NLK,RAF1,MAP3K2,STK3,MAPKAPK3,AKT3,TAOK3,IKBKG,SOS1,PTPN5,EGF,IL1R2,MKNK1,MAPK1,PLA2G4B,IKBKB,TNF,CACNA1I,TP53,RASGRP1,ARRB2,FGF16,PTPN7,MAPK3,RELA,FGF7,CACNA1E,DUSP1,MAP2K1,MAP2K7,MAP3K1,CACNG3,CACNA2D4,PAK1,PPM1B,RRAS,CACNA2D3,IL1R1,PPP3CC,FGF9,PDGFA,CACNG8,TGFBR2,PPP3R2,CASP3,DUSP9,MAP3K14,ZAK,FGF8,FGF19,RPS6KA4,MAP2K2,STK4,CACNB1,PLA2G4F,HSPA6,ELK1,MAP3K6,HSPA2,IL1A,BRAF,DAXX,MAPKAPK2,PLA2G4E,HSPB1,MAP4K3,RAC3,MAPK10,FGFR2,CACNB2,PAK2,HSPA8,MAP3K4,PLA2G4C,RELB,CRK,MAPK14,SRF,LRRK2,FGF18,DUSP4,RAC2,RPS6KA5,EGFR,DUSP16,DUSP8,ARRB1,MAX,PLA2G4D,ELK4,PRKCD,PDGFRB,FGF1,CACNA1F,HSPA1L,CACNA1B,STMN1,MAP2K3,DUSP10,RAC1,FGF20,MP1,MAP2K5,FLNC,TGFB1,RAPGEF2,RASA1,KRAS,TAOK1,NF1,MAPK13,DUSP7,CDC42,RASGRP4,RAP1A,MKNK2,FGF12,MAP3K8,CACNB4,RASGRP3,PDGFB,MAP3K7,NFKB1,FLNA,FOS,TNFRSF1A,PRKCG,NFATC1,FGF2,MAP3K5,GNG12,MAPK7,MAP3K13,MAPK8IP3,NR4A1,TRAF6,TGFB3,PPP3R1,ATF4,NTRK2,RASGRF2,HSPA1A,MAPK8IP2,HRAS,TRAF2,MAP3K12,NFKB2,NTF4,FASLG,PRKACB,ARAF,CDC25B,RASGRP2,NFATC3,NTRK1,IL1B,AKT1
eIF5A regulation in response to inhibition of the nuclear export system	Model of eIF5A regulation in response to inhibition of the nuclear export system. Under normal conditions, IGF2BP1 is exported by XPO1 and binds to eIF5A in cytoplasm. The binding with IGF2BP1 prevents eIF5A from accumulating in mitochondria. SINE (Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export) inhibits the nuclear export of IGF2BP1, resulting in decreased cytoplasmic IGF2BP1. Unbound eIF5A accumulates in mitochondria and induces apoptosis.

ApoE and miR-146 in inflammation and atherosclerosis	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) enhances purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1 (PU.1)-dependent miR-146a transcription to suppress nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-driven monocyte and macrophage activation and thereby inflammation and atherosclerosis.Environmental ligands of toll-like receptors (TLRs), including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), caused by hyperlipidemia provoke inflammatory signaling in monocytes and macrophages resulting in NF-κB activation. Gene transcription from NF-κB activity results in the production of inflammatory mediators, including proatherogenic cytokines. It also results in the production of primary miR-146a (pri-miR-146a) that is subsequently processed into mature miR-146a that silences the expression of key TLR-adaptor molecules interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The production of miR-146a thereby serves as a regulatory feedback loop to suppress NF-κB activity and resolve inflammation. Findings from our study identified that cellular apoE expression contributes to amplify this regulatory feedback loop by increasing PU.1-dependent transcription of pri-miR-146a and thereby mature miR-146a production.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3926 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MIR146A,APOE,IRAK1,TLR4,SPI1,NFKB2,TRAF6,TLR2,RELA
DNA Replication	Studies in the past decade have suggested that the basic mechanism of DNA replication initiation is conserved in all kingdoms of life. Initiation in unicellular eukaryotes, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), is well understood, and has served as a model for studies of DNA replication initiation in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans. In general terms, the first step of initiation is the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor. Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE). The unwound region provides the substrate for primer synthesis and initiation of DNA replication. The best-defined eukaryotic origins are those of S. cerevisiae, which have well-conserved sequence elements for initiator binding, DNA unwinding and binding of accessory proteins. In multicellular eukaryotes, unlike S. cerevisiae, these loci appear not to be defined by the presence of a DNA sequence motif. Indeed, choice of replication origins in a multicellular eukaryote may vary with developmental stage and tissue type. In cell-free models of metazoan DNA replication, such as the one provided by Xenopus egg extracts, there are only limited DNA sequence specificity requirements for replication initiation.

Cell-type Dependent Selectivity of CCK2R Signaling	This pathway is based on Figure 7 of "Cell-Type Specific CCK2 Receptor Signaling Underlies the Cholecystokinin-Mediated Selective Excitation of Hippocampal Parvalbumin-Positive Fast-Spiking Basket Cells."(See Bibliography).The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) acts through its receptor CCK2R to achieve largely different functions in different types of cells. CCK, CCK2R, and CB1R have all been known to have substantial effects on anxiety and other mood disorders, and the PV+ interneurons have also been shown to be involved i na variety of cognitive functions. However,  In PV+ basket cells and CCK+ basket cells, the CCK2 receptor uses different pathways to exert different effects on the two types of basket cells. For CCK+ basket cells, CCK2 receptors in neighboring pyramidal cells act through the Gq pathway to form endocannabinoids, which, through the cannabinoid receptor type 1 on the CCK+ basket cell, inhibit the release of the neurotransmitter GABA. In contrast, for PV+ basket cells, CCK2 receptors act through the pertussin-toxin sensitive Gi pathway to regulate the intracellular Ca2+ through ryanodine receptors. This pathway ultimately leads to activation of a non-selective cationic conductance to depolarize the PV+ basket cells.

Translation inhibitors in chronically activated PDGFRA cells	Chronic stimulation of the PDGFRA receptor results in decreased phosphorylation of RSK1/2 and S6K1/2, which subsequently impairs the phosphorylation of S6 ribosome protein and associated ribosome biogenesis and 5′ TOP mRNA translation. The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and PDCD4 are suppressed, which subsequently limits the components of the eIF4F complex (eIF4E and eIF4A) from joining into the complex. In addition, the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF4B is also decreased. These changes result in a suppressed CAP-dependent translation initiation in cells with chronic stimulated PDGFRA signaling compared with acute stimulated ones.Based on figure S7 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238596/ Zhou et al].

AGE/RAGE pathway	Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are heterogeneous group of non-enzymatic malliard reaction products of aldose sugar with proteins and lipids. Formation of AGEs is an indicator of one of the many chemical modifications of proteins and DNA that occur within the biological systems. Research over past two decades have implicated the role of AGEs in most of the age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disorders, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment and skin disorders. AGEs also modify the skin collagen and accelerates the aging process. In diabetic patients, AGE formation occurs in large scale and manifests with clinical symptoms such as cataract, atherosclerosis, nephropathy and neuropathy.AGEs are known to bind with different cell surface receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (AGE-R1), protein kinase C substrate, 80KH phosphoprotein (AGE-R2), galectin-3 (AGE-R3), and class A macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II.  RAGE, is the well-studied receptor for AGEs and the signaling events mediated by others are either not been identified or are considered as negative regulators of RAGE signaling. RAGE is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is constituted of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. RAGE is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as lung, heart, kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and in different types of cells including endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Besides AGEs, RAGE also mediate the effects of its other extracellular ligands namely extracellular high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100 family of calcium binding proteins and amyloid-beta peptide, among many others. Although a large number of advanced glycation end products have been identified in humans, AGE/RAGE signaling ex-vivo is mostly studied using the AGEs such as AGE-modified albumin, N(6)(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(6)(carboxyethyl)lysine and pentosidine.The signaling events mediated by RAGE are complex due to the diversity of its ligands and their effects in different cell types. Homodimerization of RAGE has been identified to be essential for RAGE signaling. Depending on the intensity and duration of RAGE ligation, specific signaling modules such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, CDC42/RAC, SAPK/JNK and NF-κB has been shown to be regulated in different cell types. AGEs have been shown to induce the formation of complexes containing RAGE with DIAPH1, SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha, TIRAP/MYD88/IRAK4 and RHOA. RAGE-DIAPH1 interaction is required for the activation of RAC1/CDC42 pathway leading to neurite outgrowth and regulation of cytoskeleton.Activation of PKC-alpha through RAGE/SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha by AGEs has been suggested as a mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells. RAGE also shares the adaptor molecules such as TIRAP, MYD88 and IRAK4 of toll-like receptors and induce the activation of AKT, p38MAPK and NFKB pathways. AGEs have also been shown to induce the formation of complex between RAGE and RHOA. RHOA/ROCK dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) is required for the regulation of gap formation and actin reorganization, and thereby endothelial permeability. However, in tubular cells, AGEs inhibit phosphorylation of ERMs leading to inhibition of tubulogenesis. Similarly, AKT have been shown to be activated by AGEs and induce proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells where as phosphorylation of AKT is shown to be inhibited in podocytes leading to FOXO4 activation and apoptosis. The major component of AGE/RAGE signaling is the oxidative stress induced pathways. AGEs induce the oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidases. Increased intracellular oxidative stress leads to stimulation of PKC and ERK1/2, resulting in the translocation and activation of NF-κB and subsequent up regulation of NF-κB dependent genes which ultimately produce deleterious effects to cells.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/age_signaling_pathways.html NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2324 CPTAC Assay Portal]	Protein
Endometrial cancer	Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy and the fourth most common malignancy in women in the developed world after breast, colorectal and lung cancer. Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. The morphologic differences in these cancers are mirrored in their molecular genetic profile with type I showing defects in DNA-mismatch repair and mutations in PTEN, K-ras, and beta-catenin, and type II showing aneuploidy, p53 mutations, and her2/neu amplificationPhosphorylation information collected from PhosphoSitePlus (https://www.phosphosite.org)Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4155 CPTAC Assay Portal]	TCF7L2,CDKN1A,AXIN2,RAF1,AXIN1,FGFR1,AKT3,FGFR2,EGF,ILK,CTNNA1,SOS1,MAPK1,PIK3R3,DDB2,BAD,HRAS,BAX,MAPK3,TP53,CTNNA3,PIK3R2,EGFR,MAP2K1,CTNNA2,CTNNB1,FGF1,TCF7L1,FGFR3,ARAF,PDPK1,AKT1,APC2,PIK3R1,KRAS,GSK3B,PIK3CA,SOS2,GADD45B,ERBB2,FOXO3,MAP2K2,AKT2,BAK1,LEF1,CCND1,CASP9,FOS,GRB2,FGF2,APC,MYC,ELK1,PIK3CB,POLK,PIK3CD,TCF7,BRAF,PTEN,GADD45G,NRAS,CDH1,GADD45A
Factors and pathways affecting insulin-like growth factor (IGF1)-Akt signaling	The signaling pathway that involves insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and a variety of other components that affect the pathway, plays an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth. The kinase Akt, or protein kinase B (PKB), is a central component in the pathway and is involved in both muscle synthesis, through mammalian target of rapmycin (mTOR) and glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B), and muscle degradation, through the transcription factors of the FoxO family. The pathway also involves several feedback loops such as the negative feedback of S6K, phosphorylated by mTORC1, which  inhibits IRS, or the positive feedback of mTORC2, which is necessary to maximize the activation of Akt. A variety of other factors and pathways also influence the IGF1-Akt signaling pathway at various points.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3850 CPTAC Assay Portal]	SMAD3,PLD1,TWEAK,N-WASP,IGF1rec&#xA;,AKT1,RPTOR,LC3,S6K,ILK,DEPTOR,SMAD2,PGC1&#xA;,IRS1,MURF1&#xA;,Myostatin,MLST8,4EPB,Integrin B1,AMPK,AKT1S1,PI3K,TNFa,TNFrec,PTEN,IGFBP5,IGF1,RICTOR,PDK1,MAPKAP1,NEB,EIF2B2,ActRIIB,GSK3B,MAFbx,NFKB1,FoxO ,MTOR
Imatinib and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	Hematopoietic Stem Cells found in bone marrow can differentiate into Monocytes and Erythrocytes, or in the case of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), they can continue to proliferate, undifferentiated, in blood. CML is caused by the Philadelphia translocation (Ph), which puts ABL behind BCR. The BRC-ABL fusion is a constitutively on tyrosine kinase that indirectly counteracts erythroid differentiation, thus promoting the continued proliferation underlying CML. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds ABL and in turn promotes healthy erythroid differentiation by counteracting BRC-ABL activity. Imatinib resistance can be conferred by the over-expression of ABC drug transporters and competitive binding kinasesThe pathway diagram above aligns molecules with the cell fates they promote, to help keep track of inhibition-of-inhibition-of-inhibition sequences, for example. The known mechanisms of imatinib resistance are at the bottom, under CML cell fate and are shown interacting with imatinib, which is under the erythrocyte cell fate.

Blood Clotting Cascade	Coagulation is a complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel), wherein a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding (hemorrhage) or clotting (thrombosis).Source: [[wikipedia:Coagulation|Wikipedia]]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP272 CPTAC Assay Portal]	Thrombin (II),Factor Va,Factor XIIIa,Plasmin,SERPINE1,Factor XIIIb,Factor X,Factor IXa,Factor XII,FGA,Factor Xa,FGB,VWF,KLK1,Factor II,SERPINF2,Factor VIIIa,Factor IX,Tissue Factor,FGG,Factor VIII A1,Factor V,Factor VIIa,Factor XI,Plasminogen,Factor VIII,Factor VII,Factor XIIa,tPA,SERPINB2,PLAU,KLKB1,Factor XIa
The influence of laminopathies on Wnt signaling	The current pathway represents the different molecular interactions that may occur following the dis-regulation of signaling pathways involved in adipocyte differentiation and proliferation which may result in the abnormal distribution of white adipose tissue, leading to the onset of lipodystrophic syndromes. This laminopathic pathway stems from mutations mainly occuring in the LMNA gene can be associated with the onset of other laminopathic syndromes due to a malfunction in the lamin A processing pathway.Other laminopathic diseases are associated with LMNA mutations, thus this pathway represents the overlapping interactions involved in such phenotypic diseases.

Integrated Breast Cancer Pathway	This pathway incorporates the most important proteins for Breast Cancer. The Rp score from the Connectivity-Maps (C-Maps) webserver was used to determine the rank of the most important proteins in Breast Cancer. These proteins were then used to determine the most important pathways involved in Breast Cancer by using the Human Pathway Database (HPD). The pathways retrieved from the Human Pathway Database were from several sources such as Protein Lounge, BioCarta, KEGG, and NCI-Nature. The pathways were then annotated. Protein-protein relations for the most important proteins for Breast Cancer were determined by annotating the pathways and by literature review.

NAD+ metabolism	NAD+ metabolism in different cellular compartments. The different precursors to intracellular NAD metabolism - tryptophan, nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide, NR, and NMN - are shown, along with their extra-cellular metabolism by CD38 and CD73. The cytoplasmic and nuclear NAD+ pools probably equilibrate by diffusion through the nuclear pore. However, the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to both NAD+ and NADH. Reducing equivalents generated by glycolysis are transferred to the mitochondrial matrix via the malate/aspartate shuttle and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle. The resulting mitochondrial NADH (malate/aspartate shuttle) is oxidized by complex I in the electron transport chain, whereas the resulting FADH2 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle) is oxidized by complex II. In each of the three compartments, different NAD+-consuming enzymes lead to the generation of nicotinamide, which is recycled via the NAD+ salvage pathway. Different forms of the NMNAT enzyme and sirtuins are localized in different compartments. The nature of the salvage pathway for NAD+ in mitochondria has not been fully resolved, although NMNAT3 has been found in mitochondriaProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3644 CPTAC Assay Portal]	NMNAT2,NRK,SIRT3,SIRT5,NMNAT3,ART,NMNAT1,NADK,SIRT6,PARP1,SIRT1,CD38,SIRT4,SIRT2,NAMPT,CD73,SIRT7
miRNA Regulation of DNA Damage Response	This is the first out of two pathways which deals with the DNA damage response. It is comprised of two central gene products (ATM and ATR) influenced by different sources of DNA damage (in blue). The two central genes can both be divides into their most important genes. For the ATM pathway these are TP53 and CHEK2, while CHEK1 is most important for the ATR pathwayThe goal of this first pathway is to provide an overview of the most important gene products, processes and changes in cell condition elicited by the DNA damage response while keeping it clear and understandableAlso some microRNAs are implemented to visualize the possible effects they can induce. By doing so a better understanding of the role microRNA play in the DNA damage response might arise.All processes take place in the cytoplasm, except when mentioned differently.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1530 CPTAC Assay Portal]	HUS1,CDKN1B,TNFRSF10B,CASP8,ATM,hsa-mir-24-1,CCND2,SESN1,GADD45G,PRKDC,GADD45A,CASP9,NBN,ATR,DDB2,TP53AIP1,MIR15A,CDK5,BAX,TP53,BBC3,PMAIP1,CDK6,CREB1,RPA2,FANCD2,CHEK1,RAD1,RFC,PIDD,CYCS,MIR145,TLK1,MDM2,GADD45B,BID,PML,CCND3,CCNE2,CDC25A,RAD50,MRE11,CCNB1,CHEK2,CASP3,APAF1,RAD51,CDK4,CCND1,RAD17,CCNB2,RB1,E2F1,RAD52,CCNB3,FAS,CCNE1,RRM2B,CDK1,BRCA1,MIR20A,CDKN1A,CDK2,TLK2,H2AFX,CCNG1,ABL1,SFN,SMC1A,c-Myc,CDC25C,ATRIP,RAD9A
Synthesis and Degradation of Ketone Bodies	Ketone bodies are three water-soluble compounds (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, acetone) that are produced as by-products when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver and kidney. They are used as a source of energy in the heart and brain. In the brain, they are a vital source of energy during fasting.Source: [[wikipedia:Ketone_bodies|Wikipedia]]	ACAT1,HMGCL,BDH,HMGCS2,OXCT1
EGF/EGFR Signaling Pathway	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also known as ErbB1/HER1 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinaseswhich also includes ErbB2 (Neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). Several ligands such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, epigen,amphiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF and epiregulin are known to specifically bind to EGFR. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the high affinityligands of EGFR. EGF/EGFR system induces growth, differentiation, migration, adhesion and cell survival through various inter-acting signaling pathways. The binding ofEGF to the extracellular domain of EGFR induces the dimerization, activation of intrinsic kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation of EGFR at multiple residuesin the cytoplasmic region such as Tyr 1092, Tyr 1172, Tyr 1197, Tyr 1110, Tyr 1016). Activated EGFR recruits various cytoplasmic proteins which transduce and regulate theEGFR function. The proteins recruited to active EGFR include many Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain containing proteins which binds to thetyrosine phosphorylated residues in EGFR, enzymes which act on EGFR and also various EGFR substrates. One of the adapter proteins, GRB2, binds to the phosphotyrosineresidue at 1068 and recruits SOS to the membrane. SOS activates GDP/GTP exchange which recruits RAF to the membrane. RAF phosphorylates MEKs, which then activates theextracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). ERK activates a number of transcriptional regulators to induce cell growth and proliferation. GRB2 or other adaptor proteinssuch as GABs recruits PI3Ks, another major mediator of EGFR signaling. PI3Ks convert Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).PIP3 binds to PH domain of AKT and recruits it to plasma membrane. PDK1 phosphorylates AKT which in turn regulate the activity of various proteins that mediate cellsurvival. EGFR also activate phospholipase C which hydrolyses PIP2 to generate Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+from endoplasmic reticulum to activate calcium regulated pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C pathway. One of the signaling modules regulated by PKC in EGFR pathway isthe NFKB module. The protein SRC is a key player in the activation of various pathways such as RAS, PLC and also the STAT proteins in various cells. Other signaling modulesactivated by EGFR include the FAK, JNK, p38MAPK and ERK5 modules. EGFR induces the JNK pathway through the activation of G proteins such as RAC and CDC42 which recruits JNKkinases as well as regulate the actin polymerization.  EGFR also translocates from the plasma  membrane to other cellular compartments including nucleus where it directlyregulate the expression of several genes in cooperation with other transcriptional regulators such as STATs, PCNA and E2F family of proteins. Being a growth, differentiationand cell survival factor; mutations and overexpression of EGFR and also the defective regulation of its signal transduction pathways has been established to be associatedwith oncogenesis. Thus, EGFR and its signaling components are promising targets for effective therapy for various cancers. There are several proteins which have been reportedto regulate the EGFR signaling such as CBL, CSK, PKC and PTEN which promotes endocytosis or reduction in the EGFR activity or its signaling mediators. The major endocytic pathwayof EGFR is established to be the clathrin coated pits which delivers them to endosomes. The endosomal pathway recycles the membraneous form of EGFR or form multivesicular bodies (MVB)and fuse with lysosomes for to the degradation pathwayPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/EGFR1_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Human Complement System	The complement activation takes place through one or more of the well-established (alternative, classical or lectin) pathways consisting of plasma and membrane-bound proteins. All three pathways converge at the level of complement C3 [https://doi.org/10.6072/H0.MP.A004235.01] and are controlled by regulators [https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1923]. Complement C3 belongs to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family of proteins, and consists of a alpha-chain and an beta-chain. Cleavage of C3 which can be initiated by one or more of the above three distinct pathways, into C3b[Proteolysis@23-667,749-1663] and C3a [Proteolysis@672-748] is an important step in the complement activation cascade. Classical and lectin pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens (or immune complexes) use C3-convertase [C4b2a] to cleave complement C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.2.359]. However, in alternative pathway a small fraction of the C3 molecules are hydrolyzed to C3(H20) exposing new binding sites. This hydrated C3 [C3(H20)] recruits complement factor B [fB], which is then cleaved by complement factor D [fD] to result in formation of the minor form of C3-convertase [C3(H20)Bb] that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.154.3.856]. Further, addition of C3b to C3 convertase [C3bBb or C4b2a] results in C5 convertase [C3bBb3b or C4b2a3b], that cleaves complement C5 to C5a and C5b, is the last enzymatic step of the complement activation cascade [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.273.27.16828][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2387864]. During complement activation C5b interacts with complement C6, C7, C8 and C9 in a sequential and non-catalyzed manner to result in the formation of Terminal Complement Complex (TCC) [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.219766]. The entire network is considered as a simple recognition and elimination system of host-immune complexes and apoptotic and/or pathogens, and therefore promotes host immune homeostasis. The complement system is also involved in cross-talk with other processes related to coagulation, lipid metabolism and cancer. However, many pathogens counteract complement attack through a range of different mechanisms, such acquisition of host complement regulators to the surface of pathogen, or secretion of complement inactivation factors. In order to have a holistic view of the entire complement network, Dr. John D.Lambris group (University of Pennsylvania) developed the Complement Map Database (CMAP) which is a unique repository focused on documented molecular interactions described within the complement cascade and between complement and other biological systems. Information contained in CMAP (http://www.complement.us/cmap/index.php)[https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt269] is entirely based on published experimental data and is fully revised by experts in the field.

Amino acid conjugation of benzoic acid	Despite being the first conjugation reaction demonstrated in humans, amino acid conjugation as a route of metabolism of xenobiotic carboxylic acids is not well characterised. This is principally due to the small number and limited structural diversity of xenobiotic substrates for amino acid conjugation. Unlike CYP and uridine 5′-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, which are localised in the endoplasmic reticulum, the enzymes of amino acid conjugation reside in mitochondria. Unique among drug metabolism pathways, amino acid conjugation involves initial formation of a xenobiotic acyl-CoA thioester that is then conjugated principally with glycine in humans. Exogenously administered benzoic acid is metabolised to hippuric acid with a conjugation reaction in humans (as discovered in the first metabolism study in humans).

Dopamine metabolism	Dopamine is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.The dopamine system plays a central role in several significant medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is an age-related disorder characterized by movement disorders such as stiffness of the body, slowing of movement, and trembling of limbs when they are not in use. The main symptoms are caused by the loss of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra. These dopamine cells are especially vulnerable to damage, and a variety of insults, including encephalitis (as depicted in the book and movie "Awakenings"), repeated sports-related concussions, and some forms of chemical poisoning such as MPTP, can lead to substantial cell loss, producing a parkinsonian syndrome that is similar in its main features to Parkinson's diseaseThe most widely used treatment for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in the brain and various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrierDescription source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine Wikipedia]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2436 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MAOA,DDC,PPP2CB,PRKACG,MAOB,PRKACA,COMT,SOD1,NQO1,TYR,TH,PPP2CA,PRKACB

Evolocumab Mechanism	Evolocumab (Repatha) is an injectable monoclonal antibody that effectively reduces LDL-Cholesterol levels. A limited quantity of LDL-Cholesterol is extracted from circulative blood when PCSK9-bound LDLR is degraded upon internalization in Liver cells. Evolocumab competitively bind PCSK9 away from LDLR complexes, which allows LDLR to be recycled, returning to the surface and clearing additional molecules of LDL-Cholesterol. 	PCSK9,LDLR

IL-1 signaling pathway	The IL-1 family of cytokines currently consists of 11 members which are encoded by distinct genes and includes IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and the IL-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The major role of IL-1 type cytokines is to control pro-inflammatory reactions in response to tissue injury - either due to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which includes IL-1Î± and IL-1Î², plays a crucial role in many auto inflammatory diseases. IL- 1Î± and IL-1Î² are produced predominantly by macrophages and monocytes, and to a lesser extent by other cell types such as epithelial cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha, is a membrane anchored protein which signals through autocrine or juxtracrine mechanisms where as the soluble IL-1Î² acts in a paracrine or systemic manner. Significant progress has been achieved in the study of the signaling events mediated by IL-1 and the processes they control. Involvement of IL-1Î± or IL-1Î² in host responses to infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in autoinflammatory diseases makes its signaling components important candidates for drug targetting for these diseases. The two forms of IL-1 (IL-1Î± and IL-1Î²) bind to the same cellular receptor, the Type I IL- 1 receptor (IL-1RI) to induce signaling. Upon receptor engagement, IL-1R1 forms a heterodimer with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which functions as a co receptor. IL-1RAcP cannot bind directly to IL-1 but is essential for IL-1-mediated signaling. Binding of IL-1 to this receptor complex leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB through different signaling mechanisms. Two IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 have been implicated in the activation of NF-ÎºB. IRAK 1 and 2 functions as adapter proteins and protein kinases to transmit downstream signals. It recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex via an interaction with IL-1RAcP. Oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequent formation of TAK1 and MEKK3 signaling complexes relays the signal via NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase (NIK) to two I-kappaB kinases (IKK-1 and -2), leading to NF-kappaB activation. Activation of other mitogen activated protein kinases, including JNKs and p38 MAPK through various MAP2Ks also play important roles in mediating IL-1 responses by activating transcription through the AP-1 transcription factor. The above mentioned signaling events co-operatively induce the expression of IL-1 target genes such as CCL2, IL-8 and IL-6. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical Interleukin-1 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map. Regulation of IL-1 signaling can be brought about by various mechanisms. The IL-1 family member IL-1RA can bind to the IL1-R1 receptor with similar affinity as IL-1Î± and Î², but is incapable of activating the signaling response. The type II IL-1 receptor can bind to IL-1 alpha and beta but lacks signaling capacity. The naturally occurring 'shed' domains of the extracellular IL-1 receptor chains (IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL- 1RAcP) also act as inhibitors of IL-1 signaling. In the cell, IL-1R binds to toll- interacting protein (TOLLIP), which results in the inhibition of IRAK1 and by promoting efficient degradation of IL-1R by targeting the internalized receptor to endosomes. Other mechanisms such as p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of TAB1 which results in the inactivation of TAK1, and expression of genes including MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (NFKBIA) that inhibit IL-1 signaling components also serve as negative regulators of IL-1 signaling.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_1_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Cell Cycle	The cell cycle is the series of events that takes place in a cell leading to its division and duplication (replication). Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. Two key classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine a cell's progress through the cell cycle.Sources: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle Wikipedia:Cell cycle], [http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04110.html KEGG]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP179 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MAD1L1,CCND1,PCNA,MYC,RBX1,CCNB2,RB1,E2F1,MCM4,YWHAZ,E2F5,ORC3,CDK4,ZBTB17,MD1L1,DBF4A,CCNB1,CDC45,CDC25A,PKMYT1,RBL1,SMC3,YWHAB,TTK,ANAPC4,GADD45B,MCM5,CCND3,TGFB2,RBL2,CCNE2,SMC1B,YWHAG,CCNA1,HDAC2,CDC25C,CDKN2B,SMAD3,BUB1,PLK1,ORC4,CDKN1C,E2F4,MCM6,ANAPC10,CHK2,ABL1,CDC27,SFN,SMAD4,ANAPC7,TGFB1,CDKN2D,SMC1A,CDKN1A,MCM3,YWHAH,TFDP2,CDK2,ANAPC2,CCNB3,FZR1,CCNE1,ORC5,CDK1,PTTG1,CCNA2,CDC20,ORC1,CDC16,ANAPC1,CUL1,ATR,P53,WEE1,ORC2,CCND2,GADD45G,YWHAE,PRKDC,CDC7,GADD45A,EP300,GSK3B,ATM,CHK1,CC14A,SKP2,ANAPC11,CDC6,CDKN1B,WEE2,SKP1,MCM7,CDK7,STAG1,RAD21,MCM2,ORC6,MDM2,TFDP1,MAD2L2,ESPL1,ANAPC5,CDC25B,HDAC1,CCNH,YWHAQ,TGFB3,CC14B,SMAD2,PTTG2,STAG2,BUB3,CDK6,CDC23,ANAPC13,CDKN2A,CDKN2C,E2F3,E2F2
Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Netpath	The Hedgehog family of proteins are signaling proteins that are crucial for a number of physiological processes including morphogenesis during development. In adult organisms, it is also involved in the regulation of theca cell development in growing follicles and in regulating the development and function of the somatic cells of the testis. Vertebrates are known to have 3 Hedgehog genes, which show different spatio-temporal expression patterns and perform specialized functions. These are - Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The Patched (PTCH) proteins (Patched 1 and Patched 2 - PTCH1 and PTCH2) serve as receptors for the Hedgehog proteins. In the 'off' state, PTCH receptors inhibit the Smo protein by mechanism(s) which are still not understood completely. In this state, the Gli2/3 Zn-finger transcription factors are phosphorylated and processed in a proteasome-dependent manner to generate a transcriptionally repressor form. SUFU, a cytoplasmic protein, was also found to interact with all the three Gli proteins resulting in the repression of its transcriptional activity. In the 'Signaling cell', which is the cell which secretes the Hedgehog proteins, an active ligand is produced following processing of the precursor Hedgehog protein. This processing involves autocleavage by the catalytic domain and bi-lipidation (cholesterol moiety at C-terminus and palmitate at the N-terminus) of the Hedgehog protein. These active ligands travel to the 'responding cell' via interactions with glypicans and megalin. On the responding cell, the active ligand interacts with PATCHED 1 (PTCH1) and PATCHED 2 (PTCH2), which results in the activation and translocation of Smoothed (Smo) to the cilium(plasma membrane in Drosophila). Activation of Smo results in the inhibition of Gli proteolysis and the production of the transcriptional repressor form. This might also promote the formation of the transcription activator form of the protein. The G-protein coupled receptor kinase-2 enhances the association between β-arrestin 2 and Smo probably by phosphorylating Smo. The two proteins also mediates increased internalization of Smo in a clathrin- dependent process and increased Hedgehog signaling. Kif7, a Drosophila Costal2 (Cos2) homolog, is capable of interacting with the Gli proteins and is known to exert positive and negative effects on Hedgehog signaling. The Fused (Fu) homolog, which can form a complex with Kif7, Gli and and SuFu (similar to Drosophila Gli, Cos2, Su and SuFu) may also be involved in the regulation of this pathwayPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/hedgehog_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Joubert Syndrome	Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare hereditary disorder that is classified as a ciliopathy, and is caused by mutations occurring in genes essential for the development and proper functioning of primary cellular cilia. These hair-like structures located on the cell membrane are responsible for detecting and relaying external signals to the interior of the cell. The defining JS feature is the molar tooth sign (MTS), which is the particular manner in which a characteristic malformation of midbrain appears in radiological imaging, and which causes delays in both intellectual and motor development. A visual representation of the pathways underlying JS pathogenesis was synthesized, which might provide a more complete understanding of the disease, possibly aiding in better diagnosis and more successful treatmentData collection on the genes, pathways and interactions involved was done through a literature search in combination supported by online databases such as OMIM, STRING and GeneMANIA. The pathway was created using PathVisio version 3.3.0. Nodes were annotated using the appropriate Ensembl, ChEBI, or Uniprot-TrEMBL identifiers and standardized MIM notation was used to visualize the interactions between them.A final pathway containing 88 unique nodes and 71 interactions was created. The pathway highlights three functional or structural areas of the primary cilium that appear to play important roles in JS pathogenesis, namely the basal body or centriole, the transition zone and ciliary trafficking. Furthermore, two specific complexes seem to be of particular interest; the B9 ciliary complex and the centriolar satellite contain eight and three JS-associated protein respectively. Lastly, the ARL13B-PDE6D-INPP5E signaling network ensures the proper functioning of INPP5E, and enzyme that converts lipid ciliary membrane components. All three proteins have been found to be mutated in JS patients.

G1 to S cell cycle control	In the G1 phase there are two types of DNA damage responses, the p53-dependent and the p53-independent pathways. The p53-dependent responses inhibit CDKs through the up-regulation of genes encoding CKIs mediated by the p53 protein, whereas the p53-independent mechanisms inhibit CDKs through the inhibitory T14Y15 phosphorylation of Cdk2. Failure of DNA damage checkpoints in G1 leads to mutagenic replication of damaged templates and other replication defects.

Vitamin B12 Metabolism	Vitamin B12 is a water soluble, organic compound and essential nutrient involved in the everyday functioning of the nervous system and the brain. Vitamin B12 is involved in the preservation and regeneration of the myelin shealth - the protective fatty layer that acts as an insulator in nerve axons.Animals store vitamin B12 in liver and muscle and therefore eggs, milk, meat, liver are sources of the vitamin.Problems in metabolism of vitamin B12 lead to "persistent" lack of energy to perform every day tasks. The genes and pathways highlighted above describe several routes through which genes and metabolites involved in B12 metabolism are interconnected.Central B12 metabolism nodes include folate metabolism and the synthesis of the citric acid cycle intermediates and succinyl-CoA, cyanocobalamin into methylcobalamin conversion, tyrosine nitration and riboflavin pathways.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1533 CPTAC Assay Portal].

This pathway shows the main metabolites of carnosine and their relationship  with each other. 	
TCA cycle in senescence	Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a central enzyme in relation to the TCA cycle, as it converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Its activity favours TCA cycle activity. PDH is downregulated by PDH kinase (PDK) and upregulated by PDH phosphatase (PDP). PDK and PDP are respectively down and upregulated in OIS, in particular in the case of the oncogene BRAFV600E (James et al., 2015; Wiley &amp; Campisi, 2016). Due to these regulatory mechanisms, PDH is a crucial mediator of OIS for TCA activity.Malic enzyme (ME) is another crucial enzyme in the TCA cycle. There appears to be a reciprocal regulation between p53 and ME, mediated through AMPK activation. Downregulation of ME leads to p53-mediated induction of senescence, while upregulation can suppress it (Jiang et al., 2013; Wiley &amp; Campisi, 2016). Because ME uses NAD+/NADP+ and produces NADH/NADPH, downregulation of the enzyme also affects NADPH-dependent mechanisms, including antioxidant defenses. This in turn can cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate p53 through AMPK and cause senescence (Wiley &amp; Campisi, 2016).In OIS, accumulation of TCA intermediates has been observed, including alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate and malate (Kaplon et al., 2013). Further research showed that increased alpha-ketoglutarate has an effect on transcriptional regulation (Salama et al., 2014).Lipids are also part of the input of the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation has been observed to increase in OIS (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019).Malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) also plays an important role in the TCA cycle and is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Lower levels of the enzyme were observed in DNA-damage induced and proliferative exhaustion-induced senescent cells. Downregulation of MDH1 also affects the NAD+/NADH ratio, known to be related to senescence. Other enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle also affect this ratio, such as the aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1). Factors influencing NAD metabolism in senescence have been addressed in more details in https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5046	BRAF,PDP2,ME1,PDH,ME2,TP53,MDH1,GOT1,PDK1,FH

Neural Crest Cell Migration in Cancer	Neural crest cells migrate and invade as part of normal development, but also as part of neuroblastoma metastasis in cancer. Many of the same growth factors, receptors and signaling pathways are involved.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress response in Coronavirus infection	This pathway model describes how the three branches of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling pathway are activated and regulated during human Coronavirus infection [DOI: 10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. During coronavirus infection, viral proteins are produced in large amounts in the ER, exceeding the ER’s protein folding capacity and leading to large amounts of unfolded proteins. This results in ER stress and activation of the UPR through transmembrane sensors PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Pathways activation occurs when the protein chaperone GRP78 (HSPA5) dissociates from the PERK/IRE1/ATF6 to bind unfolded proteins, which leads to oligomerization, autophosphorylation and activation [DOI: 10.1107/S0907444911006445]Activated PERK inactivates eIF2α by phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in overall protein synthesis. eIF2α can also be phosphorylated by several other kinases (HRI, GCN2, PKR). PKR activation is shown to be suppressed by coronavirus nsp15 and dsRNA-binding activity of MERS-CoV protein 4a. Activated IRE1 (ERN1) has multiple downstream effects. The IRE1 RNase domain is involved in unconventional splicing of XBP1, creating XBP1S which induces expression of protein folding genes. The RNase domain can also break down mRNAs (IRE1-dependent mRNA decay, RIDD), helping to establish ER homeostasis. Finally, the kinase activity of IRE1 also activates a signaling cascade that leads to the JNK pathway, triggering to apoptosis. It is thought that the SARS-CoV E protein suppresses activation of the IRE1 pathway and SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis [10.1371/journal.ppat.1002315].Activated ATF6 is translocated to Golgi and cleaved [DOI: 10.1016/s1097-2765(00)00133-7] to release ATF6-p50, a transcription factor that induces the expression of protein chaperone genes as well as CHOP and XBP1. There is evidence that SARS-CoV infection inhibits ATF6 cleavage [10.1016/j.virol.2009.02.021].	BCL2,PPP1R16A,PPP1R1B,CHOP,SARS 8ab,XBP1,CRE&#xA;cAMP response element,SARS E

Urea cycle and associated pathways	The urea cycle converts toxic nitrogenous compounds to excretable urea in five biochemical reactions. It is also the source for endogenous arginine, ornithine and citrulline production. The process mainly takes place in the liver, partly in the mitochondria and partly in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. There are several pathways associated with  the urea cycle and with the associated disorders, parts of these pathways are also pictured here. Because there is no alternative way to convert toxic nitrogenous compounds, defects in the enzymes or transporters can lead to several diseases (diseases highlighted in pink). The diseases are characterised by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy and the severity of the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place of the defect in the cycle. Severe forms usually have an onset in infancy, while mild forms can also present in adulthood.This pathway was inspired by Chapter 4 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).For the Urea cycle without additional pathways see: WP4571	
Androgen receptor signaling pathway	Androgens, mainly testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) play significant role in the growth and development of the male reproductive organs. These steroid hormones bring about their biological functions through their associations with Androgen receptor (AR), a 110 KDa ligand dependent transcription factor that falls under the group of nuclear receptor superfamily. DHT binds the receptor with high affinity compared to testosterone. The AR gene is located in the X chromosome at Xq11-12 site. AR is cytosolic protein, which in the ligand unbound state, is present as a complex with various Heat shock proteins primarily Hsp70, 90 and 56 as well as p23. Upon ligand binding, it dissociates from the complex. AR is found to be expressed in a number of tissues and cells including prostate, testis, seminal vescicle, epididymis, skin, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver and central nervous system. The protein has four functional domains- an N terminal domain (NTD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region and a Ligand binding Domain (LBD). The DBD is a 658 amino acid residue region that has ZNF motifs which allows it bind to DNA. The rest of the domains are involved in dimerization and ligand binding. Two phosphorylation events are proposed to play very important role in the activation of the receptor upon ligand binding. The first phosphorylation event releases the ligand binding domain for hormone binding. The subsequent phosphorylation event is triggered upon hormone binding. Activated AR upon ligand binding undergoes conformational change to form a homodimer and interacts tightly with the Androgen Response Element (ARE). The androgen receptor is known to bind to many co-regulators at different time points and in different cell types. This DNA protein complex triggers the expression of various target genes that are associated with the male phenotype. Modulation of the AR activity is carried out by several transcription factors like ARA70, TR4, SRC family members and CBP/p300 and other associated proteins. FXXLF and WXXLF motifs containing coactivators such as the p160 members bind with the AF2 region of the Ligand Binding Domain of the AR. Androgen receptors are known to induce apoptosis under certain conditions. Various regulators that regulate androgen induced apoptosis include BRCA1 and Smad3 and Akt. Mutation in AR are also known to be associated in a number of diseases including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) or Kennedy's disease and Androgen Insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Abnormal amplification of the androgen gene as well as deregulation of AR gene expression have been shown to be associated with prostate cancerPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/ar_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Bile Acids synthesis and enterohepatic circulation 	Bile Acid Synthesis and Enterohepathic Circulation.In hepatocytes, cholesterol is acquired through de novo synthesis as well as receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Cholesterol is eliminated through bile acid synthesis and secretion. The first (and rate-limiting) step in cholesterol conversion  to bile acids is catalyzed by CYP7A1. Bile acids are then secreted into the bile via ABCB11 and released into the small intestine. The majority of bile acids are re-absorbed into the enterocytes via ASBT and transported back to the liver via portal circulation via NTCP.  In the hepatocyte, bile acids activate FXR, which inhibits CYP7A1. In the small intestine, bile acids also activate FXR to induce FGF15, which subsequently binds and activates FGFR4, leading to inhibition of CYP7A1, partially via ERK signalingBased on figure 1 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653253 Wang et al].

Activation of NLRP3 Inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2	Orf3a from SARS-CoV has been shown to bind TRAF3 and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The activation occurs at two points. First, by ubiquinating NF-kB (p105) to stimulate its proteolytic processing into mature NF-kB (p50), which can then go on to promote the transcription of pro-IL-1B together with RELA (p65). And second, by ubiquitinating ASC (PYCARD) in the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to its degradtion and the activation of caspase-1 (CASP1) that goes on to catalyze the production of mature IL-1B, leading to a cytokine storm. While Orf3a of SARS-CoV-2 only has 72.7% sequence identity with that of SARS-CoV, the TRAF3 binding motif PxQxS is 100% conserved (https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/#Orf3a). Chloroquine, a multi-functional antiviral, decreases the production of IL-1B by affecting "the processing of primary transcripts in the nucleus, the transport of processed mRNA to the cytosol, and the degradation of mRNA."

Nuclear Receptors in Lipid Metabolism and Toxicity	Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and eliminationIn addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequent conversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A.

Regulation of sister chromatid separation at the metaphase-anaphase transition	In prometaphase, highly condensed chromosomes establish bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle. Unattached or mal-orientated chromosomes generate a signal to delay the onset of anaphase until all pairs of sister chromatids are properly aligned on the metaphase plate. This signal is transduced by a relay of spindle-checkpoint proteins, including MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUBR1, BUB3 and centrosome protein E (CENPE), which inhibits cell division cycle 20 (CDC20)-mediated activation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Following attachment and alignment of all the chromosomes at metaphase, the checkpoint signal is silenced and APC/C initiates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of securin and activation of separase. Separase in turn cleaves a multiprotein complex termed cohesin, which creates physical links between sister chromatids to initiate anaphaseThis process may be of interest in colorectal cancer, specifically in terms of the chromosome instability phenotype, which could result from defects in pathways that ensure accurate chromosome segregation.

Hormonal control of Pubertal Growth Spurt	This pathway shows the regulation and action of the GH-IGF-1 axis. Chondrogenesis in the growth plate is the biological process that drives height gain. The Growth hormone (GH) insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis is one of many regulatory systems that control chondrogenesis. Other hormones (estrogens, androgens), paracrine factors, extracellular matrix molecules and intracellular proteins regulate the activity of growth plate chondrocytes as well. Estrogen is critical for epiphyseal fusion in both young women, as well as men. This pathway describes how the growth plate lengthens until the epypheseal plate closure occurs. GH is released by the anterior pituitary gland due to the GRH. This activates IGF-1 in muscles and bones, and promotes lengthening of the growth plate. Also, GnRH in the hypothalamus stimulates LH and FSH in the anterior pituitary which stimulate gonads to produce sex hormones, such as estrogen.	SRIF,FSH,LH,IGF-1,GnRH,GRH,GH

Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway	As part of the innate immune system, specific cytosolic pattern recognition receptors recognize DNA from invading viruses and bacteria. These receptors have specificity for certain pathogens.The three receptors that recognize double-stranded cytosolic DNA are CGAS (GMP-AMP Synthase), ZBP1 (DAI) and AIM. CGAS signals via STING (TREM173) and eventually results in expression of type I interferons. ZBP1 activates NFkb and IRF transcription factors which results in expression of interferons and cytokines/chemokines. Activation of AIM leads to the formation of the inflammasome complex, which activates caspase-1 and triggers a form of apoptosis known as pyroptosis. In addition to sensors that directly detect DNA, another mechanism exists where the foreign DNA is first translated into RNA by host polymerase. The RNA is then recognized by the RNA sensor RIG-I, which leads to NFkb and IRF activation.

Adipogenesis	The different classess of factors involved in adipogenesis are shown. Adipogenesis is the process by which fat cells differentiate from preadipocytes to adipocytes (fat cells). Adipose tissue, composed of white and brown adipose tissue, is composed of adipocytes. This pathway is primarily studied to understand factors that contribute to obesity and diabetes. Transcriptional and hormonal regulators of adipocyte formation are indicated.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP236 CPTAC Assay Portal]	ZMPSTE24,RETN,KLF7,SP1,CTNNB1,BMP2,RXRG,NR3C1,LEP,DLK1,NCOR1,SCD,TWIST1,CEBPD,IRS1,SFRP4,AHR,MIF,WNT10B,MBNL1,STAT6,MEF2A,FOXC2,NR2F1,IL6ST,LPL,PCK1,FZD1,LIFR,AGPAT2,PPARGC1A,TGFB1,LPIN2,PBEF1,OSM,SOCS3,SMAD3,SPOCK,ADIPOQ,STAT1,CYP26B1,CUGBP1,GATA2,SLC2A4,CDKN1A,HMGA1,NCOA1,IRS4,LIF,MEF2B,MIXL1,AGT,RORA,RARA,ASIP,CYP26A1,UCP1,PPARG,NCOA2,E2F1,GATA3,PRLR,NCOR2,LPIN1,KLF15,NRIP1,RBL2,FRZB,LIPE,WNT1,FOXO1A,IL6,WWTR1,GTF3A,C10orf70,ADPN,CEBPA,WNT5B,CNTFR,BMP4,DF,TNF,STAT5B,ID3,CREB1,INS,STAT5A,NR1H3,PTGIS,EBF,GADD45A,GATA4,MEF2C,TCF1,BMP3,PLIN,EGR2,PCK2,IRS2,CEBPB,PPARD,BSCL2,ADFP,SERPINE1,E2F4,IRS3P,KLF6,SOCS1,NDN,STAT3,RXRA,MEF2D,STAT2,DVL1,FAS,TRIB3,SREBF1,LMNA,GDF10,IGF1,LPIN3,HIF1A,GH1,KLF5,DDIT3,EPAS1,RB1,GADD45B,BMP1,PPARA,RBL1
Amplification and Expansion of Oncogenic Pathways as Metastatic Traits	This pathway is based on Figure 4 of "Origins of metastatic traits."(See Bibliography).The majority of cancer cells released from tumors die off, so cancer biologists are trying to figure out exactly what gives certain cells the ability to colonize other distant organs. Specific genes and mediators of metastasis have been identified, but it remains mostly unknown how cancer cells acquire these traitsMetastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output: These pathways demonstrate metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is augmented by VCAM-1 and SRC, leads to increased cell survival, a significant metastatic trait. Similarly, TCF augments the output of the NOTCH and, along with periostin, Wnt signaling pathways. As the signaling of these pathways increases, the metastatic and oncogenic potential of the cell also increaseMetastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output: This pathway demonstrates metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output. Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) in renal cell carcinoma leads to increased activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Histone H3K27 and CYTIP give the VHL-HIF pathway access to new target genes. Each of these new target genes, in this case CXCR4, VEGFA, and CYTIP, lead to an increase in a metastatic trait. Here, the level of metastatic fitness is not linearly proportional to pathway activity; rather, the pathway activates an additional set of factors that affect metastatic fitness.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3678 CPTAC Assay Portal]	HIF2A,VCAM1,LEF1,CXCR4,TNC,JAGGED,CYTIP,Periostin,VHL,VEGFA,TCF7L2,SRC,Wnt,TCF7,TCF7L1,PI3K,NOTCH
Parkinsons Disease Pathway	Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic Parkinson's disease (having no specific known cause). A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known genetic factors. Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. These genes code for alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 or dardarin), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1 and ATP13A2.[4][22] In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.[4] The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2. Mutations in genes including SNCA, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD. The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies.[22] Missense mutations of the gene (in which a single nucleotide is changed), and duplications and triplications of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic casesSources: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease wikipedia], [https://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe/pathwayview.aspx?pathwayID=345 Qiagen], and [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05012.html KEGG].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2371 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PINK1,HTRA2,EPRS,CYCS,CASP6,TH,SNCA,GPR37,UBA7,SEPT5,UCHL1,CASP2,UBB,DAT,SNCAIP,UBE2J2,UBE2J1,LRRK2,CCNE1,UBE2G2,UBE2L6,MAPK14,DDC,UBA1,SYT11,MAPK12,CASP9,UBE2L3,ATXN2,CASP7,APAF1,DJ1,UBE2G1,MAPK13,CASP3,Parkin,CCNE2,MAPK11
Computational Model of Aerobic Glycolysis	Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADHThis pathway was made during a research project at the UMCG, concerning changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg Effect.

DNA IR-damage and cellular response via ATR	In fission yeast, the rad3 gene product plays a critical role in sensing DNA structure defects and activating damage response pathways. A structural homologue of rad3 in humans has been identified based on sequence similarity in the protein kinase domain.  ATR (for Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is considered the mammalian counterpart of yeast rad3, Mec1p, and fruit fly Mei-41, proteins involved in DNA damage responsesThe ATR protein is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family and plays an important role in UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint response and its role as a signal transducer in cell cycle checkpoint has been well established.  Even though it is currently unclear whether ATR functions as a damage sensor, recent evidence shows that ATR may function as an initial sensor in the DNA damage checkpoint response.  Moreover, it has been found that ATR is a DNA-binding protein with higher affinity to UV-damaged than undamaged DNA.  In addition, damaged DNA stimulates the kinase activity of ATR to a significantly higher level than undamaged DNAATR is structurally related to ATM (for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) as well as the yeast PIK family members Mec1p and Rad3.  Mec1p and Rad3 participate in checkpoint pathways induced by DNA replication blocks, DNA strand breaks, and other chromosomal abnormalities, which implies that ATR performs similar functions in mammalian cells.  Reports have demonstrated that overexpression of a catalytically inactive version of ATR (ATRki) in human fibroblasts caused hypersensitivity to gamma-radiation and hydroxyurea and abrogation of the radiation-induced G2 checkpoint.  The checkpoint defects observed in ATR-overexpressing cells resemble those found in AT cellsAdditionally, ATR functions as an upstream regulator of p53 phosphorylation in DNA-damaged cells.  ATR phosphorylates p53 at both Ser-15 and Ser-37 in vitro, suggesting that ATR is directly involved in the modification of p53 in DNA-damaged cells.  Recent reports concerning ATM, suggest that ATR and ATM play both overlapping and independent roles in the phosphorylation of p53 during cellular exposure to genotoxic stressAtr is localized to the nuclei of primary spermatocytes, cells that are undergoing meiosis I.  It has been demonstrated that both Atr and Atm proteins have associated protein kinase activity, consistent with their primary structures.  Additionally, Atr and Atm show specific association with chromosomes in cells that are in early meiosis I as demonstrated by antibody localization on surface-spread spermatocytes.  Both the Atr and Atm proteins are present at pairing forks in meiotic prophase as chromosomes synapse; however, they do not colocalize, instead they occupy complementary positions: Atr localizes along unsynapsed chromosome axes and Atm interacts with synapsed axesMeanwhile ATM is activated by damage-induced rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation prior relocalization to sites of DNA breaks, ATR activation seems to require single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with replication protein A.  The recruitment of ATR to damage sites appears to be mediated by an ATR-interacting protein that forms a stable complex with the vast majority of ATR in human cells.	ATM
Nicotine Activity on Chromaffin Cells	Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.In chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, nicotine binds to the ganglion-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is composed of alpha 3 (CHRNA3) and beta 4 (CHRNB4) subunits. By binding to the receptors, nicotine causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage dependent calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from the chromaffin vesicles into the bloodstream, which leads to increased heart rate and blood pressure and elevation of blood glucose level.Sources: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA162355620&amp;objCls=Pathway PharmGKB:Nicotine in Chromaffin Cells], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine Wikipedia:Nicotine]	CHRNA3,CACNA1G,CHRNB4,CACNA1C

FABP4 in ovarian cancer	Regulation of FABP4 in ovarian cancer. FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein) can substantially increase metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells, and leads to more aggressive disease. Mir-409-3p negatively regulates FABP4 in ovarian cancer cells, and mir-409-3p is decreased in hypoxic conditions. Pink arrows indicates potential therapuetic therapeutic stratgeies; in Gharpure et al, DOPC nanoliposomes containing either miR-409-3p mimic or FABP4 siRNA was shown to inhibit tumor progression.Description was adapted from Gharpure et al.

Glycolysis in senescence	Glycolysis appears to be upregulated in most senescent phenotypes. This is hypothesized to match with the increased need for proteins and lipids needed for senescence-associated events such as extracellular secretions (SASP) and cell enlargement (Wiley &amp; Campisi, 2016). It is also supposed to cause an increase in NF-κB signalling and cause inflammatory cascades associated with senescence. Glycolysis is also responsible for increased lactate production by producing pyruvate, along with several other mechanisms including upregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase (PKM), serinolysis and glutaminolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PKM) is responsible for the last conversion step of glycolysis, producing pyruvate. The enzyme is upregulated in replicative senescence and leads to increased TCA activity and oxygen consumption rate (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019). Findings were similar in another study on oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (Dörr et al., 2013). PKM is also thought to increase lactate production indirectly (Zwerschke et al., 2003). In parallel, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) is also upregulated, which leads to this increase in lactate levels in senescent cells. Senescence induced by oncogenes also has an impact on serinolysis and glutaminolysis. These are processes in which serine and glutamine are consumed to produce energy. They usually take place in tumour cells as an alternative source of energy, and produce lactate (among others) as a by-product. It has been found that both processes are increased in OIS, and lead to increases in lactate levels (Mazurek et al., 2001). Such increased levels of lactate lead to several events associated with senescence, such as tumorigenesis, wound healing and evasion from immune responses (Nacarelli &amp; Sell, 2017). The upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes seems to mediate increased glycolysis in various types of induced senescence. Depending on the stimulus, various proteins and genes influence glycolytic rates. For example, in irradiation-induced senescence, this effect seems to be mediated by AMPK activation and NF-kB signalling (Nacarelli &amp; Sell, 2017). Similarly, in OIS, the retinoblastoma protein appears to upregulate glycolytic genes (Nacarelli &amp; Sell, 2017). The very important p53 is known to be a central mediator of senescence, due to its role in cell cycle regulation. It has been found to negatively affect glycolysis (Gu et al., 2018). However it also has an indirect positive effect on it, by activating G6PDH in stressed cells (Jiang et al., 2011). TP53 is therefore thought to have a regulatory role on glycolysis and is interesting in the context of senescence.While most glycolytic enzymes are upregulated (Zwerschke et al., 2003), GAPDH seems to decrease. This may partially be explained by the sensitivity of the enzyme to oxidative stress	TP53,G6PD,LDHA,RB1,GAPDH,PGK1,PKM
Peptide GPCRs	G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein–linked receptors (GPLR), constitute a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with G proteins, they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times.

Thiamine metabolic pathways	Thiamine is absorbed in the form of thiamine or thiamine monophosphate and transported through the plasma membrane by thiamine transporter 1 (THTR1) and thiamine transporter 2 (THTR2), which are encoded for by the genes SLC19A2 and SLC19A3, respectively. Upon cell entrance, thiamine undergoes pyrophosphorylation by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK) to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP is the active form of thiamine and serves as a cofactor of transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol. TPP also functions as a cofactor for pyruvate, ketoglutarate and branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases in the mitochondrion after entrance via TPP transporter encoded by SLC25A19. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 15 (Thiamine Disorders) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).

Corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathway	Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide secreted abundantly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and cerebellum in the central nervous system. It is also expressed in adrenal gland, placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin. CRH is the principal mediator of endocrine stress response. CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses, hemodynamic actions, stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle, implantation of blastocyst, maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection. Excess secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased levels of cortisol have been observed. CRH has also been reported to be involved in anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa. Decrease in cortical CRH content has been observed in Alzheimer's disease  and Parkinson's disease.The actions of CRH are mediated through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) called the CRH receptors (CRHR). CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1 and also binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity. CRH receptors do not have any intrinsic kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins. The CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and Î²-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH. Binding of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by activating it. This further activates GÎ±-subunit and its subsequent dissociation from the GÎ²Î³ dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with GÎ±-subunit of different G-proteins such as GÎ±s, GÎ±i/o, GÎ±q/11 activate numerous downstream signaling cascades and result in the induction of various cellular responses. The pathways that are activated upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B. CRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory (Gs) protein which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and Î²-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids from adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response. CREB also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS. The activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of POMC. Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production. The biological functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3 and MAPK14. MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2 and induction of POMC in corticotrophs. MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition of IL-18 expression in human keratinocytes. The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate the transcription factors - ELK1, SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the expression of ADRBK2, which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors.The PLC/PKC pathway is activated by coupling of the CRH receptors to the GÎ±q/11 proteins. This cascade stimulates the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of FOS as well as NR4A1 and NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation of AP-1 complex and subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation â€“ KRT1, KRT14 and IVL. This cascade also inhibits the expression of CYP11A1 and HSD3B1, the genes involved in progesterone synthesis in placental trophoblasts.Another important signaling pathway activated upon CRH stimulation is the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP, involved in the control of vascular tone. In human keratinocytes, upon CRH stimulation, NFKBIA degradation is diminished and the activity of NFKB is inhibited resulting in the down-regulation of NFKB-dependent genes IL2 and HSP90AA1 and inhibition of cell proliferation. The gene involved in cell survival, BCL2 is transcriptionally regulated via the PI3K/AKT.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/CRH_pathway.html NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2355 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MAP3K5,TCF4,GNAI1,NR4A1,TBX19,PRKCB,PARP1,RAP1B,PRKAA2,CASP9,FOS,PRKCA,TLR4,ECE1,CACNA1H,FOSL1,FOSL2,CASP12,PLCG1,NFKB1,GNB2,GSK3B,HSP90AA1,GNAO1,ACACA,PLCG2,CYP11A1,CRH,IL8,AKT1,GNAI2,SP1,MAP2K1,CTNNB1,EPAC,NR4A2,RELA,ERN,RHOA,TFAP2A,MAPK1,ARRB2,CRHR2,MAPK3,GNB5,FOSB,PLCB3,CREB1,Ligand,CRHBP,BRAF,GJA1,CAMK2A,NCOA2,MAPK9,ELK1,CYP11B1,PRKCI,IL18,SULT2A1,CYP21A2,NOS3,JUND,CASP3,GNAS,POMC,BCL2,GNB1,CRHR1,JUNB,Receptor,GNAQ,IL2,ADRBK2,NFKBIA,MAPK8,ARRB1,GNAZ,IVL,GNA11,HSD3B1,JUN,PRKCD,MAPK14,STAR,TRIM28,GNB3,PRKCQ,KRT14,HSD3B2,KRT1,GRK6,PRKA,CYP17A1,PTK2
Matrix Metalloproteinases	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases; other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. The MMPs belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamilyCollectively they are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins, but also can process a number of bioactive molecules. They are known to be involved in the cleavage of cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the FAS ligand), and chemokine/cytokine in/activation. MMPs are also thought to play a major role on cell behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration (adhesion/dispersion), differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and host defense.Source: [[wikipedia:Matrix_metalloproteinase|Wikipedia]]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP129 CPTAC Assay Portal]	MMP2,TCF20,MMP17,MMP3,MMP27,MMP11,BSG,MMP1,MMP8,MMP13,TIMP3,TIMP1,MMP25,MMP26,MMP20,MMP21,MMP24,MMP10,MMP9,MMP28,MMP12,MMP7,MMP23B,MMP15,MMP14,MMP23A,TIMP4,MMP19,TNF,MMP16,TIMP2

Gene regulatory network modelling somitogenesis 	Reaction scheme of the proposed gene regulatory network (GRN).The scheme details the full GRN for one cell and part of a neighboring cell for those reactions that involve ligand-receptor interactions like in Delta-Notch signaling or input from the Fgf8 or Wnt3a signal transduction pathways. Color-coded circular areas for each gene symbolize mRNA and protein. For fast changing gene products the transport of mRNA or protein between cytoplasm and nucleus or between cytoplasm and membrane is explicitly simulated, which is indicated by dividing each half-area of the circle again. Regulatory interactions are shown as activating or repressing arrows. Broken lines indicate that the interaction is simulated only in an even more course-grained manner than the other gene regulatory reactions. NICD, which originates through cleavage reactions following DLL1 ligand binding to the NOTCH1 receptor, was assigned a separate symbol to clarify that only the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor acts in the nucleus as a transcription (co)-factor. The (weak) modulating action of LFNG on D/N signaling is shown as dashed lines - (red for the case of inhibiting action, green for the case of a positive effect on the D/N reaction rate.) Arrows pointing to the symbol for the empty set designate decay reactions of a species. We suppressed them for all species' decays except for those decay rates that we assume as controlled by signal transduction pathways. This applies also to the removal of DLL1 and NOTCH1 from the membrane after their binding, resulting in NOTCH1 cleavage and NICD split-off.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2854 CPTAC Assay Portal]	FGF8,LFNG,HES1,TBX6,HES7,MESP2,NICD,DLL1,NOTCH1,RIPPLY2,WNT3A,EPHA4
Eukaryotic Transcription Initiation	In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors, are responsible for modulating transcription rate.

Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma	HNSCC, which includes malignant squamous lesions arising in the oral cavity, larynx and pharynx, is the seventh most common cancer in the worldHNSCC has a remarkable multiplicity and diversity of genetic alterations. Most genomic alterations in HNSCC converge in a handful of molecular pathways resulting in cell cycle deregulation, genomic instability, cell differentiation defects, and persistent mitogenic signaling, the latter involving aberrant PI3K/mTOR pathway activation thereby rendering HNSCC responsive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.Pathway is based on [https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4348071 Fig 1 from Iglesias-Bartolome et al], [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14129 Fig 5 from Li et al] and [https://clinicalgate.com/the-molecular-pathogenesis-of-head-and-neck-cancer/ Fig 33-3 from Clinicalgate].

Metapathway biotransformation Phase I and II	Biotransformation is the chemical modification (or modifications) made by an organism on a chemical compound. If this modification ends in mineral compounds like CO2, NH4+, or H2O, the biotransformation is called mineralisation.Biotransformation means chemical alteration of chemicals such as nutrients, amino acids, toxins, and drugs in the body. It is also needed to render non-polar compounds polar so that they are not reabsorbed in renal tubules and are excreted. Biotransformation of xenobiotics can dominate toxicokinetics and the metabolites may reach higher concentrations in organisms than their parent compounds.

Glycosylation and related congenital defects	Glycosylation is the most common postranslational modification. Defects in this pathway lead to autosomal recessive disorders, called Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Up to date about 50 CDGs have been identified and more are expected to be discovered. This category of metabolic disorders can be divided into four basic groups depending on where the glycosylation process occurs on the molecule. The depicts pathway depicts the group of N-glycosylation. Generally, N-glycosylation processes spread over three cellular compartments - cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The associated mortality rate  in combination with the limited treatment options for CDG, points out the relevance for further investigations of this pathway. Disorders resulting from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 30 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).	
NAD Biosynthesis II (from tryptophan)	As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate de novo pathway, in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate (see NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). In eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with tryptophan (this pathway)The role of tryptophan as a precursor in eukaryotic NAD biosynthesis was first suggested by nutritional studies in which humans stricken with pellagra, a nicotinamide (niacine) deficiency disease, recovered after the addition of tryptophan or niacin to their diets (Krehl et al). Other studies established tryptophan as a precursor of NAD in many animal and plant systems (Foster et al). This pathway is closely related to the catabolic pathway of tryptophan (tryptophan degradation I (via anthranilate)), suggesting an evolutionary link between the two.Though rare, the synthesis of NAD from tryptophan in prokaryotes has been observed in several organisms. Wilson and Henderson reported that Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni requires niacin for growth and can use tryptophan or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid as a substitute [Wilson63]. Some members of the Actinomycete group were also reported to utilize tryptophan for NAD biosynthesis (Lingens et al).Recent studies based on comparative genome analysis have identified the five genes involved in the "eukaryotic" pathway in several bacterial strains, confirming that some bacteria may indeed utilize this pathway rather than the aspartate pathway (Kurnasov et al).In yeast, the de novo pathway consists of six enzymatic steps (catalyzed by the products of the BNA genes) and one non-enzymatic reaction. After the last enzymatic reaction (catalyzed by Bna6p), the de novo pathway converges with the salvage pathway (Panozzo et al).In plants:In plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate (NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). However, the finding of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway (this pathway) in the genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to be further investigated (Katoh et al).Adapted from   [http://biocyc.org/META/new-image?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=NADSYN-PWY&amp;detail-level=3&amp;ENZORG=TAX-9606 BioCyc]	AFMID,TDO2,NADSYN1,HAAO,NMNAT1,KMO,KYNU,QPRT

Synaptic signaling pathways associated with autism spectrum disorder	Synaptic signaling pathways associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)Changes in mTOR activation is believed to be a risk factor for ASD. mTOR is regulated by the TCS1/2 complex, and several signaling pathways upstream of TSC1/2 positively or negatively regulate this complex, including PI3K–AKT, Ras–ERK, LKB1–AMPK and Wnt–GSK3β pathwaysThe mTOR pathway is also regulated by the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a key role in the development and the plasticity of the central nervous system and is considered a risk factor for ASD. Increased levels of BDNF concentration have been observed in the serum and brain of patients with ASD.mTOR is a key modulator of protein synthesis and thus blocks the activation of cell autophagy and promotes cell proliferation, growth, and differentiationProteasome activity is also affected by neuronal activity, via increased expression of UBE3A through transcription factor MEF2, which leads to the internalization of AMPA-R.Variations in the Calcium-channel CACNA1C are also associated with ASD and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_syndrome Timothy Syndrome].Adapted from figure 1 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085908/ Daghsni et al].

Mammary gland development pathway - Embryonic development (Stage 1 of 4)	The mammary gland development can be subdivided into four stages of development: (1) embryonic development, (2) puberty, (3) pregnancy and lactation and (4) involution. In the embryonic development, a pair of mammary lines (ectoderm) arises, which gives origin to a pair of placodes. Then, each placode penetrates the underlying mesoderm. This results in the formation of the primary mammary gland [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14668814 3]NRG3 is a signal for placode formation. Besides that, it influences cell fate: it binds to its receptor, ERBB4, and induces MYC, which decreases expression of the integrins ITGA6 and ITGB1. The result is a change in cell adhesion and proliferation and consequent exit from the stem cell compartment [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17880691 1]Another process that should be highlighted in the embryonic development is the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ZEB2 is an EMT regulator. It represses many genes (eg. CCND1, SFRP1, MIR200A, MIR200B, MIR429, TERT, CDH1, CLDN4 and ALPL), and also upregulates mesenchymal markers [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2]. CCND1 and SFRP1 are related to cell proliferation, and SFRP1 are also related to WNT signaling pathway. MIR200A, MIR200B and MIR429 are microRNAs. TERT is responsible for elongation of telomere ends. CDH1 and CLDN4 are associated with cell adhesion, and ALPL may play a role in skeletal mineralization. Many genes modulate ZEB2. Some of these are shown in the figure [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2]. TGFB1, TNF and IL1 are cytokines and AKT1 plays a role in many processes like cell proliferation, survival and growth. Hedgehog signals upregulate ZEB2 via TGFB1 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592 2].

DNA Mismatch Repair	DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is responsible for correcting mismatches and small insertions and deletions caused during replication and recombination. In eukaryotes the process of MMR is initiated by MutSalpha and MutLalpha, homologs of the E.coli proteins MutS and MutL. MutS homologs first recognize the error in DNA, and then physically interact with MutL, which activates other proteins that remove the erroneous DNA strand and synthesize a new one.''In vitro'' MMR requires a nick requires a preexisting nick (single-strand gap) in the DNA substrate. Similarly, it is thought that for ''in vivo'' MMR in eukaryotes, newly synthesized lagging-strand DNA transiently contains nicks (before being sealed by DNA ligase) which provides a signal that directs mismatch proofreading systems to the appropriate strandThis pathway describes the slightly different mechanisms for MMR based on the location of the nick in relation to the mismatch (5' and 3'). Mutations in the genes coding human MutS and MutL homologs have been linked with the Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by an increased risk of developing cancer.This pathway is based on figure 1 from [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28356513/ Hsieh et al], with additional information from [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/10/ REPAIRtoire], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_mismatch_repair Wikipedia] and [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03430 KEGG].

IL-18 signaling pathway	Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and was initially described as an IFN-ÃŽÂ³-inducing factor derived from anti-CD3-stimulated Th1 cells. IL-18 plays a significant role in the activation of hematopoietic cell types mediating both Th1 and Th2 responses and is the primary inducer of interferon-ÃŽÂ³ in these cells. The biological activity of IL-18 is mediated through its binding to the IL-18 receptor complex (IL-18R) and activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), culminating in the production and release of several cytokines, chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules. In certain cell types, IL-18 also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K/AKT signaling modules leading to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-18 mediated signaling acts as one of the vital components of the immunomodulatory cytokine networks involved in host defense, inflammation, and tissue regeneration.

Oxidative Stress	Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between the production and manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Disturbances in the normal redox state of tissues can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Some reactive oxidative species can even act as messengers through a phenomenon called redox signalingIn humans, oxidative stress is involved in many diseases. Examples include Sickle Cell Disease,[1] atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome[2] and chronic fatigue syndrome, but short-term oxidative stress may also be important in prevention of aging by induction of a process named mitohormesis.[3] Reactive oxygen species can be beneficial, as they are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogensSource: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Oxidative_stress]])Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP408 CPTAC Assay Portal]	NFE2L2,UGT1A6,XDH,MGST1,NFKB1,NOX3,NQO1,GSTT2,MAOA,FOS,GPX1,CAT,TXNRD1,TXNRD2,GSR,HMOX1,MAPK10,SOD1,CYP1A1,NFIX,NOX5,SOD3,MAPK14,MT1X,NOX4,TXN2,SP1,GPX3,NOX1,JUNB,SOD2,GCLC,CYBB

Caloric restriction and aging	Caloric restriction leads to a decrease in the ATP/AMP ratio, thereby activating the key nutrient sensor of the body: AMPK.AMPK then blocks mTOR function, as mTOR has an important role in regulating the balance between cell growth and autophagy, nutrient decrease leads to the induction of autophagy.AMPK stimulates NAMPT function and PGC-1a release. NAMPT converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide for NAD+ synthesis. PGC-1a is the regulator of mitochondrial biosynthesis (increasing mitochondrial cell mass to produce more ATP) which thus will increase if more PGC-1a is releasedLevels of NAD rise during caloric restriction leading to increased SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 blocks the Insulin/IGF-1 pathway. This is a very complex and paradoxal tissue, which need further investigation/researchIncreased SIRT1 activity leads to activation of FOXO/p53 genes. FOXOs become phosphorylated by AKT and this may attenuate apoptotic stimuli and reduce antioxidative stress expressionIn the end these effects result in increased stress resistance and improved lifespan and health span.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4191 CPTAC Assay Portal]	p53,insulin/IGF1,SIRT1,FOXO,mTOR,AKT,NAMPT,AMPK,PGC-1a
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling pathway	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential for growth, differentiation, plasticity, and survival of neurons. BDNF is also required for processes such as energy metabolism, behavior, mental health, learning, memory, stress, pain and apoptosis. BDNF is implicated in various neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.BDNF binds to tyrosine kinase receptor known as tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). It also binds with low affinity to p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF and its receptors are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system.BDNF signaling is elicited when it dimerizes and binds to TrkB, resulting in the receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. The activation of the receptor results in its interaction with molecules such as Shp2, Shc and PLC-gamma. These molecules further interact and modify their downstream targets leading to various neuronal processes. BDNF activates the signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, PI3K/Akt, Ras/Erk, AMPK/ACC and NFκB pathways. BDNF through PLC/PKC pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It also maintains synaptic plasticity through cAMP/PKA signaling. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway through BDNF/TrkB interaction inhibits cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of BIM. However, BDNF/p75NTR interaction activates JNK through TRAF6, which leads to apoptosis. Activation of JNK3 also leads to proteolytic cleavage of the p75NTR by TACE. PI3K/Akt also leads to activation of mTOR pathway and subsequently protein synthesis. Ras/Erk signaling is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and protection of neurons. BDNF also leads to neuronal survival through Erk5/Mef pathway. Phosphorylation of synapsin by Erk1/2 leads to neurotransmitter release. BDNF signaling leads to nitric oxide production through NFκB pathway. BDNF induces neurite outgrowth through activation of JAK/STAT, Rac, and Cdc42 pathways. BDNF enhances oxidation of fat through AMPK mediated inhibition of ACC. It also plays role in microtubule assembly through inhibition of GSK3-beta. It leads to oxidative neuronal necrosis through activation of NCF molecules. BDNF also regulates the surface expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors. BDNF also regulates the expression of genes leading to processes such as differentiation of dendrites and calcification of cementoblast-like cells.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2380 CPTAC Assay Portal]	IKK1,CYFIP1,IKK2,IkkG

Biomarkers for urea cycle disorders	Urea cycle disorders are caused by enzyme or transporter defects in the Urea cycle (WP4571). These diseases are characterised by hyperammonemia, respiratory alkalosis and encephalopathy and the severity of the disease depends on the severity of the defect and the place of the defect in the cycle. Severe forms usually have an onset in infancy, while mild forms can also present in adulthoodThe diagnosis of Urea cycle disorders is based on altered concentrations of different metabolic biochemical markers. Some of these markers are metabolites in the Urea cycle, but there are also several other markers, that are either indirectly or not related to the Urea cycle. All metabolic markers used for the diagnosis of at least one Urea cycle disorder and their relations are visualized in this pathway.Biochemical markers derived from http://www.iembase.org/, for all diseases pictured in WP4571

Zinc homeostasis	Zinc is a transition metal and catalytic cofactor involved in many biological processes such as proliferation, development and differentiation, regulation of DNA synthesis, genomic stability, cell activation, RNA transcription, immune function. Zinc homeostasis in cells is ensured by various protein families including zinc transporters, zinc-binding proteins (Metallothioneins, MTs), transcription factors (MTF1-2). ZnT (1-10) transporters are responsible of zinc efflux and are assigned to the SLC30A family while ZIP (1-14) transporters are responsible for the influx of zinc into the cytoplasm and are assigned to the SLC39A family. Zn2+ enters into the cell by the ZIP transporters, and once inside the cell is available to bind metalloproteins (MT) which deliver to ZnT, or the zinc can bind to directly ZnTs and then deliver in the organelles / vesicles or lead outside the cell. Elevated zinc levels have been reported in different tumour tissue, such as breast and lung cancer	SLC30A9,SLC30A1,SLC30A7,MT2A,SLC30A5,MT1X,SLC39A11,SLC30A2,MT3,SLC30A8,MT1A,SLC39A14,MT1H,MT1E,MT1F,SLC39A5,SLC39A4,SLC30A10,SLC30A3,MT4,SLC39A10,SLC39A7,SLC39A2,SLC39A9,SLC30A4,SLC39A12,SLC39A1,MTF1,SLC30A6,SLC39A6,SLC39A13,MT1M,SLC39A8,MT1L,MT1G,SLC39A3,MT1B

Copper homeostasis	Copper is a redox-active transition metal and an essential trace element for life. It is a catalytic cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in critical biological processes (eg. detoxyfication by oxygen free radicals, angiogenesis, pigmentation, peptide hormone production, etc.). However, "free" copper is harmful for cells because can generate ROS that leads to cellular damage. Thus, all organisms and cells maintain a tight control of its uptake, trafficking and export. This process is rather intricate and requires an interplay between numerous biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, metabolites...) that act as copper ions importers (CTR1, CTR2, DMT1, Prp, APP), chaperones (CCS, ATOX1, COX17, COMMD1) and exporters (ATP7A, ATP7B). Copper ions and Cu-indipendent stimuli (hormone, oxygen, phosphorylation and ubiquination) seem to affect localization and expression of Cu-transporters and chaperones. Potential target of copper ions seem to be crucial signaling pathways, such PI3K/Akt, in which copper induces insulin-like effects. Copper dyshomeostasis could be implicated in cancer and a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease and ALS.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3286 CPTAC Assay Portal]	STEAP4,ATP7A,FOXO3,MT4,PIK3CA,COX17,CPHL1P,CASP3,GSK3B,PTEN,MTF1,SLC11A2,ADAM9,SLC31A1,SCO2,SCO1,CCS,MTF2,ATP7B,APC,CCND1,MT1L,MT1G,MT1B,SOD1,STEAP3,TP53,MT2A,PRNP,APP,SOD3,SLC31A2,ADAM10,MT1X,MT1JP,FOXO1,AKT,COX11,MAPT,STEAP2,STEAP1,MT3,XIAP,JUN,BACE1,COMMD1,MDM2,MT1A,XAF1,ATOX1,MT1H,MT1F,ADAM17,MT1E,SP1

Robo4 and VEGF Signaling Pathways Crosstalk	This pathway is based on Figure 2 of "Robo4" (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2637482/). The gene Robo4 plays a role in regulating vascular stability in mice. Robo4 inhibits the gene Notch1, which regulates tip cell formation, in order to create more tip cells. Robo4 also inhibits cell migration, decreasing vessel complexity. The combination of Slit2 and Robo4 inhibits the activation of Src by VEGF-165 and VEGFR2. This inhibition reduces vascular leakage of Evans Blue from retinal blood vessels. More experimentation is necessary to determine whether Robo4 will inhibit other members of the Src family.

Melatonin metabolism and effects	Melatonin is an important regulator of circadian rythmus and influences also insulin secretion, immune function, retinal function and neuroprotection. The synthesis starts with the amino acid tryptophan which is catalyzed to serotonin. AANAT and ASMT catalyze the reaction to N-acetylserotonin and melatonin, respectively. Melatonin is mainly discarded by the liver enzyme CYP1A2 but other enzymes from the cytochrome family are also known to metabolize melatonin.

Estrogen signaling pathway	Estrogen receptor refers to a group of receptors which are activated by the hormone 17-beta-estradiol (estrogen). Two types of estrogen receptor exist: ER which is a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors and the estrogen G protein coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER), which is a G-protein coupled receptor. The main function of the estrogen receptor is as a DNA binding transcription factor which regulates gene expression. However the estrogen receptor also has additional functions independent of DNA binding.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP712 CPTAC Assay Portal]	GFRs,ER-AF1,CHUK,PI3K,MAPKK,JNKs,Non-ERE,SP1,c-Jun,GNGT1,MAPKKK,ELK,ER,NFKB,ER-AF2,PKACA,IKBKB,C-FOS,GSA,ERE,CREB,GPR30,TF,BCL2 Apoptotic switch,PKB/Akt,IKBKG,p38,GNB1,ERK 1/2
RAS and Bradykinin pathways in COVID-19	This pathway describes imbalances in RAS and Bradykinin pathways in COVID-19.The expression of several genes in this pathway is affected in by SARS-CoV-2: * SERPING1 is downregulated, which cancels the suppression of F12 of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, resulting in the production of bradykinin from kallikrein and KNG* ACE is downregulated, which increases bradykinin levels* ACE2 is upregulated, ACE is downregulated, which causes an increase in Angiotensin 1-9 and sensitization of bradykinin receptors* NFkappaB is suppressed by SARS-Cov-2, decreasing its binding to the ACE promoter and subsequent transcription.The result of a hyperactive bradykinin system is vasodilation to the point of vascular leakage and infiltration of inflammatory cells.The pathway is based on figure 2A from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7410499/ Garvin et al.]	NOS1,AGTR2,IL1B,SERPINE1,AGTR1,ROCK1,CYP3A4,AGT,RHOA,IL1A,ACE,PRKG1,BDKRB2,VDR,CYP24A1,SERPING1,TNF,NFKB1,ACE2,NOS3,CPN1,KLK1,MAPK1,KLKB1,F12,KNG1,REN,BDKRB1
Transcriptional cascade regulating adipogenesis	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) lies at the core of the transcriptional cascade that regulates adipogenesis. The expression of PPARG is regulated by several pro-adipogenic (green) and anti-adipogenic (orange) factors. PPARG itself is activated by an as-yet-uncharacterized ligand. CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPA) is regulated through a series of inhibitory protein–protein interactions.

Amino Acid Metabolism Pathway Excerpt (Histidine catabolism extension)	This pathway was created based on findings from the bachelor thesis project by Kristin Koppelmaa which investigated vitamin D GWAS results.Thesis DOI: https://figshare.com/articles/From_SNPs_to_Pathways_Functional_Interpretation_of_Vitamin_D_GWAS_Results/8796710This pathway shows an excerpt of the WikiPathways amino acid metabolism (WP3925) pathway containing the segment between the metabolites histidine and glutamate that was extended. The proteins added to the conversion were AMDHD1 and UROC1. Although the HAL and FTCD proteins were included in the amino acid metabolism pathway previously, the lead SNP rs7487782 which exists in both HAL and AMDHD1, was added to the pathway and linked to these two genes. This variant was mapped to these genes during the analysis of a dataset originating from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29343764 PMID: 29343764].	GLUD1,UROC1,FTCD,GPT2,AMDHD1,HAL
Hair Follicle Development: Cytodifferentiation - Part 3 of 3	The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically, the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2804 Induction], [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2839 Organogenesis] and Cytodifferentiation.Hair follicle cytodifferentiation is the third main step in hair follicle development and leads to the formation of the bulbous peg.

Genotoxicity pathway	This pathway describes the transcriptomic biomarker TGx-DDI genotoxicity assay (consisting of 64 genes) developed to readily distinguish DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agents from non-DDI agents. Abstract from the paper "Development and validation of a high-throughput transcriptomic biomarker to address 21st century genetic toxicology needs" by Li et al. (2017) published in PNAS:Standard in vitro assays to assess genotoxicity frequently generate positive results that are subsequently found to be irrelevant for in vivo carcinogenesis and human cancer risk assessment. Currently used follow-up methods, such as animal testing, are expensive and time-consuming, and the development of approaches enabling more accurate mechanism-based risk assessment is essential. We developed an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker-based approach that provides a robust biomarker reflecting stress-signaling responses. The biomarker correctly identifies the vast majority of irrelevant genotoxicity results from in vitro chromosome damage assays. TGx-DDI, a multigene biomarker for DNA damage-inducing agents, is the first biomarker that not only shows convincing interlaboratory and intralaboratory reproducibility, but also performs accurately in a system suitable for high-throughput screening.

7-oxo-C and 7beta-HC pathways	The Oxysterol group of compounds are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol or its sterol precursors, e.g. 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) or desmosterol. There are three mechanisms leading to the formation of oxysterols:1. Enzymatically (first steps of sterol metabolism, being intermediates for the formation of steroid hormones, bile acids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3); see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4545 WP4545]. 2. Non-enzymatically by encountering reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing a second pool of metabolites (this pool also includes oxidized cholesterol molecules taken in from diet); described in this pathway.3. Generation by the gut microflora and uptake through the enterohepatic circulation. Previously oxysterols where though to be inactive metabolic intermediates, however recent findings have established that these metabolites are involved in cholesterol homoeostasis, can be ligands to nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors and biomarkers of diseases (for example Niemann-Pick disease).This pathway describes Figure 4 and 5 from Griffiths et al (2020) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.prostaglandins.2019.106381] and will be extended with disease information.

Wnt/beta-catenin Signaling Pathway in Leukemia	The Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway mediates the transcription of proteins important for maintenance and growth of hematopoietic stem cells.

ATM Signaling Pathway	Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a highly pleiotropic, autosomal recessive disease that leads to multisystem defects and has an intricate cellular phenotype, all linked to the functional inactivation of a single gene. Extensive research on the phenotype and the recent discovery and cloning of the responsible gene point to a defect as a central biochemical locus which links several signal transduction pathways that operate under stress as well as in normal physiological conditions.Ataxia is the first symptom in all patients and is predominantly truncal, first manifested in swaying of the head and trunk on standing and even sitting. Truncal ataxia precedes appendicular cerebellar disease. In the first years of life, certain manifestations are present such as dysarthria, muscular hypotonia, the slow initiation and performance of all voluntary movements, characteristic hypotonic facies and postures, and drooling. Dyssynergia and intention tremor of the upper extremities become a major feature after the fifth year of life. The tendon reflexes are diminished or lost, but may be normal or even hyperactive in the early stages. All these observations show a clear ataxia of cerebellar type, initially of station and gait, and later of intention. Early observations of brains from patients with A-T showed neurodegenerative changes, particularly in the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Neuronal degeneration is also present in the brainstem, and dentate and olivary nuclei atrophy. Neuronal loss occurs in the substantial nigra and oculomotor nuclei, dorsal root ganglia, and degenerative changes are evident in spinal motor neurons, and dorsal root and sympathetic motor neurons. Moreover, multiple abnormalities in Purkinje cell development have been observed in an Atm-deficient mouse model. Misplaced Purkinje cells have been observed in both the granular and molecular cell layers. In addition, Purkinje cell dendrites tend to grow laterally instead of extending towards the surface of the cerebellum.ATM (for Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has been located by restriction-fragment length polymorphism in the chromosome 11, location: 108,093,211-108,239,829. Interestingly, the site of ATM is the same or adjacent to the region occupied by CD3 (Antigen, Delta subunit), THY1 (T-Cell antigen), and NCAM (Cell Adhesion Molecule, Neural, 1) genes, all of which are members of the immunoglobulin-gene superfamily and consequently may be subject to the same defect that afflicts the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin molecules in A-T. The ATM gene presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 9,165 kb cDNA and is constituted by 66 exons spread over 150 kb of genomic DNA which has a transcript of 12 kb. The ORF of this transcript predicts a 370-kDa protein composed of 3056 amino acids. Over 300 mutations have been found in A-T patients, distributed across the full length (150 kb of genomic DNA) of the ATM gene.Sequence homology indicates that the atm gene product falls into a family of proteins that are related to the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family includes TEL1, MEC1, TOR1, and TOR2 of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD3 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 of Drosophila melanogaster. The mammalian family member most closely related to ATM is the ATR/FRP1 protein and, like its yeast homologs, it mediates cellular responses to unreplicated or damaged DNA. In humans the PI 3-kinase family includes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and FRAP. These sequence homologies appear to reflect functional homology because many of the PI 3-kinase family members are involved in DNA repair, recombination and cell cycle control. Despite the resemblance to lipid kinases, members of this family, including ATM, possess a serine/threonine protein kinase activity, which is wortmannin sensitive.ATM phosphoprotein is ubiquitously expressed and predominantly found in nuclei of proliferating cells, but subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed that 10-20% of the protein is present in cytoplasmic vesicles, including peroxisomes and endosomes and a prominent cytoplasmic fraction in mouse oocytes. ATM is endosome-bound in mouse neurons, suggesting molecular sorting of the protein occurs in the cytoplasm. In Purkinje cells, distribution of ATM protein is primarily in cytoplasm, and this may be related to the differentiation state of the cells. ATM mRNA is present in all human and mouse tissues. In situ hybridization shows that ATM mRNA is expressed throughout the whole mouse embryo. Furthermore, ATM has been associated with beta-adaptin in lymphoblast vesicles indicating that it may play a role in intracellular vesicle and/or protein transport mechanisms. No obvious nuclear localization signals have been detected in ATM. Neither an ectopically expressed N-terminal fragment of the protein nor a C-terminal fragment is capable of entering the nucleus.

Nicotine Activity on Dopaminergic Neurons	Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.In dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The main type of CNS receptor is composed of alpha 4 beta 2 (CHRNA4, CHRNB2) subunits. It has been shown that alpha 6, alpha 5, and beta 3 can also be in the receptor complex to modulate binding sensitivity. By binding to the receptor, nicotine causes cell depolarization and release of dopamine from the cell through the SNARE complex. Dopamine then binds to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) on dopaminergic terminals and activates Gi alpha (GNAI1), initiating a feedback loop to inhibit dopamine release. One of the key players mediating dopamine signaling is PPP1R1B (also called DARPP-32, dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein). PPP1R1B is a bifunctional signal transduction molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, inhibits either a serine/threonine kinase (PPKACA or PKA) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP1CA or protein phosphatase 1). When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by PPKACA at threonine 34, it is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), which inhibits dopamine secretion through the SNARE complex. When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by CDK5 at threonine 75, it is converted to an inhibitor of PPKACA. Binding of dopamine to D2-like dopamine receptors leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (ADCY2) via G-protein GNAI1, and decreases PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This, in turn, relieves the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), and inhibits further dopamine release.Sources: [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA162355621 Nicotine Pathway in Dopaminergic Neurons (PharmGKB)], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine Nicotine (Wikipedia)].Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1602 CPTAC Assay Portal]	GNG2,TH,SLC18A2,PPP1CA,GNAI1,DRD4,ADCY2,KCNK9,DDC,PPP1R1B,CHRNA5,KCNK3,SNARE Complex,CHRNA6,CHRNA3,CDK5,DRD3,CHRNB2,CHRNA4,GNB1,DRD2,PRKACA

It is also used illegally as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug. GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, beef and small citrus fruits. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.Part of this pathway was inspired by Chapter 5 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)), Fig. 5.3	
Cholesterol Biosynthesis Pathway	Cholesterol is a waxy steroid metabolite found in the cell membranes and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. It is an essential structural component of mammalian cell membranes, where it is required to establish proper membrane permeability and fluidity. In addition, cholesterol is an important component for the manufacture of bile acids, steroid hormones, and several fat-soluble vitamins. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals, but small quantities are synthesized in other eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi. It is almost completely absent among prokaryotes, which include bacteria.Source: [[wikipedia:Cholesterol|Wikipedia]]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP197 CPTAC Assay Portal]	IDI1,NSDHL,SC4MOL,DHCR7,CYP51A1,HMGCR,LSS,MVK,SQLE,FDFT1,FDPS,SC5DL,MVD,HMGCS1,PMVK

TNF alpha Signaling Pathway	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in various biological processes including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune response. TNFα is mainly produced by macrophages, also by other tissues including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and neuronal tissues. TNF was identified as a soluble cytokine produced upon the activation by the immune system and able to exert cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and cause tumor necrosis in animal models. TNF is primarily produced as a type II transmembrane protein arranged as stable homotrimers. The members of TNFα family exert their cellular effect through two distinct surface receptors of the TNF receptor family, TNFRSF1A (TNF-R1) and TNFRSF1B (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNF-R2 is found typically on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated. TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 binds membrane-integrated TNF (memTNF) as well as soluble TNF (sTNF) TNF-R1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain, called death domain (DD). This domain interacts with other DD-containing proteins and couples the death receptors to caspase activation and apoptosis. TNF-R2 induces gene expression by a TRAF-2 dependent signaling mechanism and also crosstalk's with TNF-R1. The pleiotropic biological effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously activate multiple signaling pathways in cells. Binding of TNFα to TNF-R1 on the cell surface triggers trimerization of the receptor and exposes intracellular domain of TNF-R1 following the release of an inhibitory protein. This intracellular domain recruits a death-domain containing adaptor protein, TRADD by homophilic interactions. TRADD, which acts as a scaffold protein, recruits TRAF2 and RIPK1 to form a complex , referred to as complex 1.  Complex 1 is believed to be important in NF-κB activation and JNK activation. Complex 1 eventually dissociates from the receptor and integrates FADD and procaspase8 to form a complex referred to as the complex 2. In some cases, FADD/CASP8 association depends on high molecular weight complexes containing unubiquitinated RIPK1 as scaffold. Activated CASP8 induces CASP3 activity and execution of apoptosis. CASP8 activates apoptotic signal through another mechanism involving BID cleavage to truncated BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, increasing its outer membrane permeability. This results in cytochrome C release and activation of other caspases ultimately leading to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to increase during or after complex 1 and 2 formation to mediate or potentiate apoptosis upon TNF stimulation. TRAF-2 in complex 1 also activates the MAP kinase cascade, that leads to the activation of JNK, which on prolonged activation is believed to mediate both apoptosis and necrotic cell death.  On complex 1 formation, NF-κB regulated anti-apoptotic gene products efficiently block initiation of apoptosis by complex 2. There is evidence of an early attempt to signal for apoptosis, which precedes the activation of NF-κB. The intracellular part of TNF-R1 binds to NSMAF which in turn mediates SMPD2-dependant ceramide production from cell membrane. Ceramide induces membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. This is observed before TNF-R1 internalization and NF-κB activation. This process is repressed on TNF-R1 internalization. This signal however is enough to initiate apoptosis in some cells. Another form of cell death, necrosis, is also mediated through TNF stimulation. On TNF stimulation, deubiquitinated RIPK1 dissociates from complex 1 and recruits RIPK3, FADD and CASP8. RIPK3 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates RIPK1. Taken together, it has been speculated that RIP1 and RIP3 increase carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism of the cell, leading to increased ROS production and eventual necrosis. Recruitment of CASP8, activation of FADD/RIP1 and apoptosis induction, is blunted when RIPK1 becomes ubiquitinated. IKBKG binds to ubiquitinated RIPK1 to induce the activation of NF-κB, which exerts antiapoptotic effects. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, BIRC2 and BIRC3 has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and functionally interact with TRAF2 and RIPK1  to induce polyubiquitination of RIPK1 upon TNF stimulation. Loss of these inhibitors attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 bind preferentially to Lys-63 polyubiquitinated RIPK1. This facilitates dimerization of MAP3K7, promoting its phosphorylation and activation. The IKK complex, consisting of CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG, is recruited to RIP1 through binding of IKBKG to the ubiquitin chain of RIP1. Activated TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKBKB within the activation loop, leading to activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB. Certain regulatory proteins have been known to intercept NF-κB activation at the level of ubiquitinated RIP1. TNFAIP3, an NF-κB inhibitory protein, removes Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain and promotes Lys-48 linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 leading to its degradation and NF-κB signal termination. IKBKG stabilizes the bound polyubiquitinated RIPK1 by inhibiting its degradation, most probably by impairing its interaction with TNFAIP3. OTUD7B is recruited to the activated TNF-R1 and promotes RIP1 deubiquitination, thereby attenuating NF-κB activation. At internalized TNF-receptosomes, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by endocytic vesicle associated RFFL, inducing RIPK1 degradation, which terminates NF-κB activation. When successful, TNF-induced NF-κB activation induces transcription and expression of genes encoding proinflammatory IL-6, anti-apoptotic factors BIRC2, BIRC3 and BCL-2 homologue BCL2L1. This causes the cell to remain inert to apoptotic stimuli.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tnf_alpha_pathway.html NetSlim] database.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP231 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Wnt Signaling in Kidney Disease	This pathway is modeled after Figure 5 of the article "Glomerulocystic kidney disease" (Bissler, et al. 2010). The gene product Wnt signals two different paths titled canonical and non-canonical. The non-canonical path is mediated by the membrane bound protein Disheveled (Dvl) which then controls the planar cell Polarity. The canonical path on the other hand is mediated by the cytoplasmic protein Disheveled (Dvl) and then is effected through b-catenin transcription. The complex of Nphp2 and Nphp3 seem to help facilitate the process by controlling the Wnt signaling.  Bergmann, et al. (2008) showed that Nphp3 deficiency in Xenopus resulted to planar cell polarity defects.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4150 CPTAC Assay Portal].

Novel intracellular components of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway	Viral pathogen RNA are recognized by host helicases called RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that include DDX58 (RIG-I), DHX58 (LGP2), IFIH1 (MDA5), SNW1, and DDX17. These RLR proteins then go on to initiate signaling pathways, triggering the innate antiviral response via production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. RLR pathway genes are characterized by rapid evolution, viral protein interactions, limited sets of protein domains, specific TF regulation, and densely connected interaction networks. The study by van der Lee et al. (2015) identfied novel components, DDX17 and SNW1, for the RIG-I pathway.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3865 CPTAC Assay Portal]	TBKBP1,MAP3K1,NFKBIA,ATG12,MAPK8,DHX58,RELA,IFNK,DDX58,TMEM173,CXCL10,TANK,DDX3Y,IFNA1,CXCL8,IKBKG,OTUD5,FADD,TBK1,IKBKE,IFNG,MAPK10,TRAF6,MAVS,TRAF2,IFNE,CXCL12,IKBKB,CASP10,ISG15,MAPK14,TRADD,IRF7,MAPK9,SNW1,MAPK12,ATG5,NFKBIB,CHUK,DDX3X,RNF125,PIN1,IFNB1,TRIM25,NLRX1,SIKE1,DAK,MAPK13,RIPK1,CASP8,CYLD,AZI2,NFKB1,IRF3,MAP3K7,TRAF3,IFIH1,DDX17,MAPK11
Hair Follicle Development: Organogenesis - Part 2 of 3	The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically, the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2804 Induction], Organogenesis and [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2840 Cytodifferentiation].Hair follicle development is a process dependent on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions orchestrated by many signaling pathways. Here we find one of three complex regulatory pathways assembled from a text mining approach portraying the development of this key mammal-specific structure.

Ferroptosis	Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death which is distinct from apoptosis and necrosis, since cell death occurs due to failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses in regulating iron. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced from accumulated iron and lipid peroxidation (regulated by GrX4 and 15-LO).Ferroptosis is important in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction induced epilepsy and neurodegenerative disease. Ferroptosis can be induced to treat multiple forms of cancer by inhibiting tumor growth, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Ferroptosis has also been linked to neurodegenerative disease, possibly through increased inflammation caused by release of lipid metabolitesDescription adapted from [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa04216 KEGG] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroptosis Wikipedia].

Ras Signaling	Ras proteins are small GTPases and are involved in transmitting signals within cells. In this way, Ras signaling controls many downstream processes, including cell proliferation, survival, growth, migration and differentiation. Ras proteins exists in two states, inactive while bound to GDP and active while bound to GTP. The exchange of GTP for GDP on RAS proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Activated RAS regulates cellular functions through a set of effector molecules, including Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ral guanine nucleotide-dissociation stimulator (RALGDS).Mutations in Ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately lead to cancer. The 3 Ras genes in humans (HRas, KRas, and NRas) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer.

NAD metabolism, sirtuins and aging	A model for DNA damage, inflammation, NAD+, and agingTwo key events, the activation of PARP by DNA damage and the decreased NAMPT expression associated with inflammation, lead to decreased SIRT1 and SIRT3 activity in the nucleus and mitochondria, respectively. Decreased SIRT1 activity is associated with further PARP activation and increased DNA damage. Decreased SIRT1 also leads to NF-kB activation and decreased FOXO3a activity, two factors that lead to increased inflammation. These contribute to the establishment of two parallel feed-forward self reinforcing loops that further accelerate the aging process. This process is initiated earlier and faster in patients with DNA damage repair defects (such as CS, XPA, and AT). Mitochondrial function is diminished as a result of decreased SIRT3 activity, leading to mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, whereas decreased SIRT1 is associated with decreased TFAM (necessary for mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription) and decreased PGC-1a (necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis). Possible therapeutic interventions to restore NAD+ levels are illustrated for each of the key enzymes (red arrows).

IL17 signaling pathway	Interleukin 17 is a family of cytokines that acts as potent mediators in delayed-type reactions by increasing chemokine production in various tissues to recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation, similar to Interferon gamma. IL-17 is produced by T-helper cells and is induced by IL-23 which results in destructive tissue damage in delayed-type reactions. Interleukin 17 as a family functions as proinflammatory cytokines that responds to the invasion of the immune system by extracellular pathogens.

Pathways Regulating Hippo Signaling	Hippo signaling and the activation of YAP1/TAZ transcription is regulated by many other pathways (green labels) and factors. For example, the activation of SMAD and Beta catenin/TCF/LEF via TGF-beta signaling and WNT signaling pathways, respectively, enhanced the transcription of YAP1/TAZ target genes. This enhanced activity induces more aggressive  phenotypes of malignant mesothelioma cells such as cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).

Differentiation Pathway	This pathway provides an overview of the directed differentiation molecules used to induce early and derivative cell lineages from human pluripotent stem cells. This overview differentiates between the three primary germ cell layers (ectoderm-outer layer, endoderm-inner layer, mesoderm-middle layer), which are formed in the earliest state of embryonic development and give rise to different tissue types.

The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to have a significant correlation with the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. The signaling pathway regulates many cellular processes such as protein synthesis, proliferation, survival, metabolism, and differentiation, all factors that would increase a cancerous cell's ability to survive.

SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Pathway	Collaborative project for curation biological processes involved in the COVID-19 disease after SARS-Cov-2 infection. It focuses on experimental evidence and plays with improved annotation of complexes and with the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology. The complexes link to EBI's Complex Portal, resulting from a collaboration with that database at the recent online ELIXIR biohackathon. Editing this pathway is (at this moment) coordinated via the wikipathways.slack.com #sarscov2 channel. Additionally, please feel free to add suggestions to the discussion page (see the tab at the top of this page). The large viral Spike protein (S or surface glycoprotein) forms trimers. It interacts with the host's ACE2 receptor to establish binding (Hoffmann et al 2020). There are suggestions for more than one cell entry mechanism, with the evidence for ACE2/TMPRSS2 entry being most clear now. Lack of expression of TMPRSS2 may explain age differences in COVID19 severity. In this mechanism, to enter the virus needs to be primed by the host protease TMPRSS2 that splits the Spike protein into 2 peptides S1 and S2. S1 contains the ACE2 receptor binding site, S2 binds to the host cell membrane which leads to membrane fusion, the start of the uptake process. The ACE2 receptor interaction was also suggested as the start of specific lung-damaging effects. Other human genes that may be involved in alternative cell uptake mechanisms include CTSL and SLC6A19.

Microglia Pathogen Phagocytosis Pathway	Pathogens are recognized by complement C1q or immunoglobulin (IgG) that bind to microglia complement receptors (e.g., ITGAM/ITGB2) or Fc-receptors (e.g., FCGR1) that signal via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecules TYROBP or FCER1G, respectively.

Nanoparticle-mediated activation of receptor signaling	Nanoparticle-mediated activation of receptor signaling. Several NP formulations were shown to interact with cellular receptors such as the EGFR and integrins, inducing cellular phenotypes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration. In lung epithelial cells, NPs interact with both EGFR and integrins, leading to cell proliferation via activation of PI3K and AKT. NPs were shown to activate the EGFR, leading in parallel to apoptosis and proliferation, and oncogenic Ras mutations might influence these effects. Interestingly, while integrin-mediated activation of ERK was instrumental for proliferation, apoptosis was mediated via activation of JNK. In addition, NPs (PM2.5) are able to bind the EGFR to activate the MAPK signaling cascade. Activation of ERK leads to the expression and secretion of the epidermal growth factor amphiregulin, thus forming an autocrine loop, which might be instrumental for sustained inflammatory responses.

Glucuronidation	Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule that can be excreted more easilyGlucuronidation is a phase II biotransformation reaction in which glucuronide acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate via the catalysis of glucuronosyltransferases. First, in a series of reactions the cosubstrate uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is formed. The glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) then catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDPGA to a substrate resulting in a glucuronidated substrate and leaving uridine 5'-diphosphate. UGTs are a very broad and divers group of enzymes and count as the most significant  group of conjugation enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism, qualitatively because glucuronic acid can be coupled to a large diversity of functional groups and quantitatively because of the large and divers number of substrates that are formed.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP698 CPTAC Assay Portal]	UGT1A10,UGT2B11,UGDH,UGT2B15,UGT1A5,UGT2A1,UGT1A3,PGM5,UGT2B28,UGT1A1,UGT2B10,PGM3,UGT2B4,UGT1A8,UGT2A2,UGT1A4,UGT2B7,UGT2B17,UGT1A6,PGM2,UGP2,UGT2A3,HK1,UGT1A9,UGT1A7,PGM1

The mere overload of nanoparticles in the vesicular system lead to cytoskeleton and cell adhesion problems and interfere with the cells autophagic system. Some specific nanoparticles are reported to interfere with the cell membrane, others stimulate the blood coagulation system. The release of metal ions from specific nanoparticles challenges the metal disposal system of the cell.

Biomarkers for pyrimidine metabolism disorders	Pyrimidine metabolism disorders are caused by enzyme defects in the metabolism of pyrimidine (WP4225). The clinical presentation of pyrimidine disorders is very diverse, because of the diversity in biological function. The severity of the disorder is determined by the severity of the defect and the function of the normal enzymeThe diagnosis of Pyrimidine metabolism disorders is based on altered concentrations of different metabolic biochemical markers. Some of these markers are metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolism, but there are also several other markers, that are either indirectly or not related to pyrimidine metabolism. All metabolic markers used for the diagnosis of at least one Pyrimidine metabolism disorder and their relations are visualized in this pathway.Biochemical markers derived from http://www.iembase.org/, for all diseases pictured in WP4225	UMPS

Phosphoinositides metabolism	Phosphatidylinositols are a family of lipids under the phosphatidylglyceride class. This pathway specifies several metabolic conversions between PIP, PIP2, PIP3 and other metabolites. Phosphorylation sites on the individual metabolites are drawn as states, with the location added as a number.The main interactions within this pathway are based on Figure 1 of [https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth867 Rusten et al], annotated with biochemical interaction database [https://www.rhea-db.org/ Rhea], and diseases (depicted in pink) with corresponding [https://www.omim.org/ OMIM-identifiers.]. Dashed lines depict proposed interactions which have not been characterised (yet)	
Prion disease pathway	Prion diseases are rare, genetic, transmissible and sporadic diseases, which are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene. This gene is located on chromosome 20p13 and is composed of two exons. Mutations in the PRNP gene cause conformational changes in the prion protein (PRNP). The normal PRNP (protein) changes into the pathologic PRNP. A molecular pathway can give a better understanding in prion diseasesThis pathway is a prion disease pathway, that describes what happens when there is a mutation in the PRNP gene. The left part of the pathway represents the pathway retrieved from literature and the right part of the pathway represents data found using databases. The left part shos the interaction of pathological prion protein with an unknown receptor protein, this interaction activates a signalling pathway. The endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium and ER stress is induced. Activation of Caspase 12 by ER-stress is followed by cleavage and activation of the executioner Caspase-3, causing neuronal apoptosis. According to the databases, NCAM-1 can initiate two mechanisms: the activation of FGFR and formation of intracellular signalling complexes. NCAM-1 interacts with Fyn and FAK, resulting in phosphorylation of these two tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of Fyn and FAK results in activation of MAPK, ERK1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors ELK and NFkB. CREB activates transcription of genes which are important for axonal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity in neurons.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3995 CPTAC Assay Portal]	SPI1,ELK1,FYN,NCAM1,MEF2C,POU2F2,HSP90B1,HSPA5,PDIA3,RFX5,EP300,PRNP (+ mutations),CASP3,SMC3,NFKB1,CASP12,BCL11A,STAT3,RXRA,TBP,RAD21,BCL2&#10;Anti-apoptotic,PRO CASP12,PAX5,CHD2,PTK2,BATF,EBF1,FGFR1,MAPK3,PRNP,MAPK1,CTCF,IRF4
Simplified Interaction Map Between LOXL4 and Oxidative Stress Pathway	This pathway Involved in chemo-resistance of cells in bladder cancer begins with LOXL2 activation of CDC37 and COL2A1. COL2A1 activates the complex NRF1/2 and two other complexes that trigger RTK/MAPK and TGFB pathways. These pathways along with oxidative stress promotes NRF1/2 activation of theoxidative stress pathway. This pathway promotes the transcription of NQO1, ECSIT, EXOC6, and SIRT1. SIRT1 then activates SUV39H1. LOXL2 also activates some of these proteins downstream in the pathway (SUV39H1, EXOC6, ECSIT).

Apoptosis Modulation and Signaling	Apoptosis, or cell death program, can be activated by various mechanisms within the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathway. While activation of cell death receptors leads to the engagement of the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway is activated by mitochondria during cellular stress, bothresulting in an activation of caspases.In the present pathway we emphasized the activation of caspases by those two pathways in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cells. Please notice, that PDAC cells are so called type-II cells. In these cells the activation of cell death receptors is not sufficient to activated caspases. By cleavage of Bid, type-II cells activate the intrinsic pathway as "amplification loop".

MAPK Cascade	The MAPK cascades are central signaling pathways that regulate a wide variety of stimulated cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and stress response.

Downregulation of ACE2 expression by SARS-CoV infection and SARS-CoV Spike protein	Schematic diagram of the renin-angiotensin system in acute lung failure and proposed SARS-CoV action. The renin-angiotensin system has a crucial role in severe acute lung injury and the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 has a protective role in acute lung failure. Because ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor, SARS-CoV Spike protein binding to ACE2 downmodulates ACE2 expression, and loss of ACE2 expression results in severe acute respiratory failure. The AT1R is the crucial receptor that mediates AngII-induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury.  SARS-CoV Spike–mediated lung failure can be rescued by inhibition of AT1R. This research was done in in vivo mice cells.

Phytochemical activity on NRF2 transcriptional activation	Based on [http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v3/n10/fig_tab/nrc1189_F4.html Surh, 2003, figure 4].NRF2 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of many detoxification or antioxidant enzymes. The Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) is a cytoplasmic repressor of NRF2 that inhibits its ability to translocate to the nucleus. These two proteins interact with each other through the double glycine-rich domains of KEAP1 and a hydrophilic region in the NEH2 domain of NRF2. KEAP1 contains many cysteine residues. Phase II enzyme inducers and/or prooxidants can cause oxidation or covalent modification (R) of these cysteine residues. As a result, NRF2 is released from KEAP1. In addition, phosphorylation of NRF2 at serine (S) and threonine (T) residues by kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is assumed to facilitate the dissociation of NRF2 from KEAP1 and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. p38 can both stimulate and inhibit the NRF2 nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NRF2 associates with small MAF (the term is derived from musculoaponeurotic-fibrosarcoma virus), forming a heterodimer that binds to the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) to stimulate gene expression. NRF2/MAF target genes encode phase II detoxification or antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase alpha2 (GSTA2), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase (gamma -GCLC and gamma -GCLM) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). PI3K also phosphorylates the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta), inducing its translocation to the nucleus and binding to the CCAAT sequence of C/EBP-beta response element within the xenobiotic response element (XRE), in conjunction with NRF2 binding to ARE. Transfection of human neuroblastoma cells with PI3K activates ARE, which is attenuated by a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K or dominant-negative NRF2. Curcumin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) disrupt the NRF2–KEAP1 complex, leading to increased NRF2 binding to ARE. Sulphoraphane directly interacts with KEAP1 by covalent binding to its thiol groups. 6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC) — a sulphoraphane analogue from Japanese horseradish wasabi — stimulates nuclear translocation of NRF2, which subsequently activates ARE.

H19 action Rb-E2F1 signaling and CDK-Beta-catenin activity	In this proposed model, H19 interacts with macroH2A, and this may consequently lead to de-repression of genes including CDK8, CDK4, and CCND1. Increased CDK4-cyclin D1 complex phosphorylates Rb to disrupt Rb-E2F1 interaction, leading to E2F1 activation. The increase of CDK8 expression enhances the function of mediator complex including MED1, and facilitates the gene regulation by β-catenin. These downstream targets could work in a synergistic way of promoting cell proliferation and increasing cell motility in CRCReference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5264449/Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3969 CPTAC Assay Portal]	CDH1,JAG1,CDK8,CDK4,CSRP2,SOX4,macroH2A,MED1,E2F1,RB1,TULP3,CTNNB1,PMAIP1,CCND1
Pathways Affected in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma	Protein pathways altered by mutations in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Pathways include epigentic modification, DNA damage checkpoint signals, MYB/MYC signalling pathway, FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling, and notch signalling. In the epigenetic modification pathway, several complexes promote the activity of HIST1H1E/HIST1H2AL which regulate chromatin remodeling. In the DNA damage pathway DNA damage in the nucleus signals to ATM and PRKDC to induce DNA repair and suspend the cell cycle. ATM further activates proteins that induce either apoptosis or DNA repair and leads to the activation of proteins that inhibit progression in the cell cycle. The MYB/MYC pathway involves the activation of protein complexes involved in inducing cell growth and proliferation by CREBBP and MYCBP. However this pathway has feedback inhibition by the binding of the MYBL1/MYB complex to NFIB which depresses MYB activity. The FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling pathway involves the activation of the FGFR4/INSRR complex by FGF16 and ERBB2 activation by ERBB2IP which leads to a signalling cascade that inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell growth and migration. The notch pathway is activated by the biding of CNTN6 to Notch leading to pathway activation. This pathway is regulated by RoxP2, CTBP1, and DTX4/FBXW7.

Irinotecan Pathway	This pathway shows the biotransformation of the chemotherapy prodrug irinotecan to form the active metabolite SN-38, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. SN-38 is primarily metabolized to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide by UGT1A1, the isoform catalyzing bilirubin glucuronidation. Irinotecan is used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, small cell lung cancer and several other solid tumors. There is large interpatient variability in response to irinotecan, as well as severe side effects such as diarrhea and neutropenia, which might be explained in part by genetic variation in the metabolic enzymes and transporters depicted here. Well-known variants to effect this pathway are the promoter polymorphic repeat in UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28) and the 1236C&gt;T polymorphism in ABCB1. While UGT1A1*28 genotype has been associated with toxicity, further evidence is needed to describe the roles of ABCB1 variants in toxicity.Source: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/search/pathway/irinotecan/liver.jsp PharmGkb]Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP229 CPTAC Assay Portal]	ABCC2,CES1,UGT1A9,ABCG2,UGT1A1,ABCC1,SLCO1B1,UGT1A10,CYP3A5,BCHE,NPC1,CYP3A4,CES2

Regulation of Apoptosis by Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein	This pathway is based on Figure 8 of "Parathyroid hormone-related protein regulates cell survival pathways via integrin alpha6beta4-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling."(See Bibliography). Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein Regulates Cell Survival Pathways via Integrin alpha6beta4-mediated Activation of PI3-K/Akt Signaling Intracrine PTHrP inhibits apoptosis by activating the PI3-K/Akt pathway by increasing levels of integrin A6B4, which signals in harmony with growth factor receptors. The activation of Akt increases the ratio of anti-apoptosis members to pro-apoptosis members in the Bcl-2 Family. The activation of Akt deactivates GSK-3 which leads to higher levels of c-myc, therefore leading to lower levels of apoptosis. Overall, intracrine PTHrP has the effect of increased cell survival on C4-2 cells.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3872 CPTAC Assay Portal]	PI3-K,BAX,BAK1,BID,BCL2,BCL2L1,BCL2A1,GSK3A,GSK3B,BCL2L14,BCL-2 family,Integrin A6&#10;,Growth Factor Receptors,BCL2L12,AKT1,Intracrine PTHrP&#10;,BOK,BCL2L13,Integrin B4&#10;,MYC,BCL2L2,BCL2L10,BCL2L15

MECP2 and Associated Rett Syndrome	MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) is in many mammals an important regulator of neuronal function and development. It affects all cell types, especially neurons but also astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells. MECP2 plays an important role in neuronal differentiation, maturation, morphology and function and influences synaptic plasticity. Mutations impairing the proper function of MECP2 are mainly associated with the Rett syndrome but may also contribute to other neurological disorders like schizophrenia, FASD (fetal alcohol syndrome), PPM-X-syndrome, autism, Prader-Will-syndrome, and Angelman-syndrome. Dependant on the cofactors MECP2 acts as an activator or repressor of transcription and micro RNA production. It affects RNA splicing and regulates chromatin structure together with HP1 and interferes in methylation of DNA (epigenetics). The expression of MECP2 itself is highly regulated by promotor elements, cis-regulatory elements, polyadenylation, promotor DNA methylation and miRNA.Please cite this pathways as: http://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP3584Ehrhart et al. 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13023-016-0545-5 - the pathway version in the paper is 90609.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3584 CPTAC Assay Portal]	CNP,AMPA,FKBP5,C/EBP,MTOR,HNRNPH1,GRID1,TAF1,SST,TET3,BRN2,DLX5,H3,SMC3,PTEN,GAD1,BDNF,NREP,IGF1,CAMK2A,MBP,E2F1,PI3K,FGF3,Ak081227,CTCF,ARHGEF26,TARDBP,SP3,GRIA1,BCL6,OPRK1,APOC2,SGK1,YB1,GRIN1,CSRP1,HNRNPF,MYT1,TAP1,GPRIN1,GABRR2,NF1,RBFOX1,FGF4,CDON,FOXG1,Ak087060,BRN3,GRIA4,DHX9,REST,MPP1,RPS6,MAG,FUS,FGF2,PRPF3,GAMT,TET1,MEF2C,HP1,HB1,DLX6,IGF2,EZH2,TET2,SIN3A,NCOR1,CREB1,IGF1R,PSIP1,FGF5,UBE3A,HDAC1,AKT1,GRIA3,FUT8,SP1,MECP2
Vitamin D-sensitive calcium signaling in depression	Depression has been linked to (lack of) sunlight exposure and raised intracellular calcium levels. In this pathway, the role of the vitamin D pathway in calcium signaling in depression is shown. Active 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 is formed from 7-dehydrocholesterol by multiple conversion steps. It associates with RXR and VDR in the nucleus, which stimulates transcription of VDR target genes, resulting in lower intracellular calcium levels. Less sunlight exposure results in lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels and therefore higher calcium levels.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer	Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process during which cells lose their epithelial characteristics, and gain mesenchymal properties, such as increased motility. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMT is associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. During EMT, tumor cells undergo tight junction dissolution, disruption of apical–basal polarity, and reorganization of the cytoskeletal architecture, which enable cells to develop an invasive phenotype. In cancer cells, EMT is abnormally regulated by extracellular stimuli derived from the tumor microenvironment, including growth factors and inflammatory cytokines, along with intra-tumoral physical stresses such as hypoxia. Therefore, EMT programming allows tumor cells to adapt to the constant changes of the human tumor microenvironment, and thus to successfully metastasize. This pathway summarizes the major signaling pathways and inducers that promote EMT in CRC.A set of core transcription factors regulate EMT: SNAIL family of zinc-finger transcription factors SNAIL/SLUG; the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) family of transcription factors ZEB1/ZEB2, and the TWIST family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors TWIST1/TWIST2.(Adapted from Vu et al.)Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4239 CPTAC Assay Portal]	CLDN14,STRAP,CLDN22,MMP9,SNAI2,MMPs,MAP2K2,WNT1,WNT9B,Claudins,TGFBR2,SPARC,SHC1,NOTCH1,CDH1,NRP2,WNT11,PIK3CB,WNT8B,FZD4,ZEB2,MAPK14,CLDN16,DLL4,Cytokeratins,VTN,WNT7B,CLDN6,TGFB1,FZD5,PROX1,COL4A2,Tyrosine kinase &#xA;receptors,MAP2K3,SMAD3,JAG2,FZD7,MMP15,MAPK13,FMNL2,CRB3,PKD1,FZD1,KRAS,CLDN5,CLDN18,FZD2,CLDN24,WNT9A,FOXC2,COL4A3,WNT3,CLDN2,CLDN15,WNT3A,CLDN8,TWIST1,EZH2,TJP1,HRAS,CLDN12,WNT10B,CLDN9,CLDN20,WNT4,CLDN7,SMAD2,TGFB3,TRAF6,FOXQ1,DLL3,ID2,COL4A5,AKT1,DLK1,EIF5A2,MMP2,CTNNB1,TGFB2,FZD9,SUZ12,MAPK11,NOTCH4,NOTCH3,HIF1A,WNT8A,COL4A1,MAP2K6,COL4A4,PIK3CD,MAPK12,GRB2,LATS2,ITGA5,WNT5A,FZD3,FOXM1,TMPRSS4,LRP6,COL4A6,OCLN,RBPJ,CLDN11,ZEB1,NR2C2,TWIST2,MAP2K4,SMAD4,FZD6,JUP,MEF2D,MPP5,MAPK8,CLDN4,AKT2,JAG1,CLDN19,RBBP4,WNT7A,ID1,PIK3CA,NUBPL,SOS2,GSK3B,PIK3R1,FZD8,TGFBR1,DLL1,FZD10,NOTCH2,GDF15,WNT2B,CDH2,CLDN1,CTDSP1,DSP,PDCD6,CDKL2,TP53,MAPK3,pre-miR-9-2,PIK3R3,MAPK1,EED,CLDN3,WNT6,AKT3,SOS1,WNT2,WNT10A,RAF1,PKP1,CLDN23,TUSC3,PAK1,WNT16,CLDN17,LRP5,SNAI1,CLDN10,WNT5B,PIK3R2,MAP2K1,FN1,Collagen,PKP2

Allograft Rejection	This pathway illustrates molecular interactions involved in the fundamental adaptive immune response for allograft destruction. This pathway was adapted in large part from [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05330.html KEGG]. In the initial step of this diagram, antigen presenting cells (APC's), either those from the donor (direct pathway) or from the recipient (indirect pathway) activate naive t cells leading to both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell maturation. CD8+ stimulated T cells lead to apoptosis of the allograft donor cells whereas CD4+ T cells differentiate into TH1, TH2, T17, and Treg cells. Activated TH1 produces TNFA and NO and damages donor graft cells by cytotoxicity. TH2 cell activates B cells. Activated B cells lead to plasma cell formation followed by IgG antibodies and the complement cascade pathway in acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and chronic AMR with C3 being the therapeutic target. Exogenous treatment with YCF inhibits C3, thus preventing AMR. Eculizumab binds to C5 which prevent C5a production and the membrane attack complex.  C3a and C35 act as potent chemotactic factors, promoting the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells. Belatacept inhibits CD80/86 binding to CD28. Corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Ketogenesis and Ketolysis	This pathway depicts several metabolic pathways involved in ketogenic diet treatmentIn hepatocytes in the liver, fatty acids (FAs) are normally transformed into acetyl-CoA, which can then enters the TCA (Krebs) cycle for energy production.However, when FA levels are to high for the TCA cycle to be utilized completely, acetyl-CoA is used in ketogenesis and ketolysisThese processes are a complex process of transporter proteins and several other (mitochondrial) pathways [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98219/figure/masino.f1/].	
Ebola Virus Pathway on Host	The Ebola virus (EBOV) pathway represents the virus infection on humans, depicted from the left to the right of the picture. The initial targets are macrophages and dendritic cells, but the virus has tropism to infect all kinds of cells, with the exception of lymphocytes. Here we represent all cells in general whithin one diagramEbola attaches to the plasma membrane and after that a viral glycoprotein induces penetration by endocytosis. This process is made by membrane proteins. During the penetration, its particles travel in compartments where viral glycoproteins are cleaved and fused to the endosomal membrane, which results in the uncoation of viral particles into the cell's cytoplasm. The virus then begins replicating and down-regulating the host's immune response. During the release process, the newly-created viruses are released from host cells, either by causing them to break apart, by waiting for their death or by budding off through their membrane. Depending on the type of infected cell some trans-infection could happen. This pathway was built using a text-mining approach to obtain interactions between genes related to this process. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive pathway depicting the Ebola pathway to date.

Classical pathway of steroidogenesis with Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid Metabolism	The biosynthesis of steroid hormones is a difficult process in which Cholesterol is transformed into mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and sex hormones via a series of hydroxylation, oxidation and reduction steps. To better understand the molecular level of sexual organ maturation in humans, the classical pathway and the alternative pathway of this process are produced. The pathways produce the main steroid hormones in humans, namely Progestogen, Corticosteroids, Androgens and Estrogens.The classical pathway is meant to produce an important steroid called Androgen, which is a synthetic steroid hormone that regulates sexual development and the maintenance of the male sex organs via binding to androgen receptors. Next to the classical pathway of androgen synthesis, alternative pathways are known, such as [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4524].For more information and details about Androgens and the diseases linked with this molecular pathway, please visit Chapter 37 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)) .We have recently expanded this pathway with information from the Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid Metabolism (previously captured in WP273; overlapping content is indicated with double borders for individual datanodes; information previously missing is added with dashed borders).Mineralocorticoid (M) and glucocorticoid (G) receptors regulate transcription; either through 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase influencing aldosterone specificity on epithelial M-receptors or by modulcation of AP-1- and NF-kappa-B-induced transcription through G-receptors. Specifically for the first case, aldosterone resistance in an autosomal form (aka pseudohypoaldosteronism) is linked to loss-of-function in epithelical Na-channel subunits [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.231]	HSD3B1,HSD3B2,CYP11A1,CYP11B2
AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Signaling	AMPK signaling pathway, a fuel sensor and regulator, promotes ATP-producing and inhibits ATP-consuming pathways in various tissues. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of alpha-catalytic and beta and gamma-regulatory subunits. Humans and rodents have two alpha and beta and three gamma isoforms; some genes are subject to alternative splicing increasing the range of possible heterotrimer combinations. Cellular stresses that inhibit ATP production or increase its consumption change the AMP:ATP ratio and activate the pathway. AMPK activation by AMP is not completely understood; the current model states that binding of AMP to the gamma subunit leads to conformational changes that allosterically activate AMPK and render phosphorylated-Thr172 unavailable for inhibitory dephosphorylation. ATP antagonizes the effect of AMP; both AMP and ATP bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the Bateman (CBS) domains of the gamma subunit. The upstream kinase, known as Lkb1, is a complex of one catalytic and two regulatory subunits; Lkb1 is believed to be 'constitutively active'. In certain cell types, Thr172 can be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CAmKK), in turn activated by calcium. A well known role of AMPK is in the regulation of lipid metabolism; it stimulates fatty acids oxidation and inhibits their synthesis. Phosphorylation by AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and results in reduced levels of malonyl-CoA product. Malonyl CoA is a substrate in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and fatty acids elongation. Importantly, it is also an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, required for the transfer of primed cytosolic fatty acids into the mitochondrion where they can undergo degradative beta-oxidation. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling pathway by activating Tsc2 and downstream of Tsc2 by inhibiting Raptor component of mTOR complex 1 [note that this effect is opposite to Tsc2 phosphorylation and inactivation by PI3K-Akt signaling downstream of insulin]. AMPK is also involved in promoting glucose uptake and utilization and integrates adipokynes and hormonal signals in both the hypothalamus and the periphery with potential impact on energy expenditure and uptake by molecular mechanisms that remain to be established. Due to its roles in fuel regulation, the AMPK pathway is regarded as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes type II, obesity and metabolic syndrome. As a note, drugs used in the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes can activate AMPK.AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The kinase is activated in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose, hypoxia, ischemia and heat shock. It exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. Binding of AMP to the γ subunit allosterically activates the complex, making it a more attractive substrate for its major upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1. Several studies indicate that signaling through adiponectin, leptin and CAMKKβ may also be important in activating AMPK.As a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, AMPK activation positively regulates signaling pathways that replenish cellular ATP supplies. For example, activation of AMPK enhances both the transcription and translocation of GLUT4, resulting in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, it also stimulates catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis via inhibition of ACC and activation of PFK2. AMPK negatively regulates several proteins central to ATP consuming processes such as TORC2, glycogen synthase, SREBP-1 and TSC2, resulting in the downregulation or inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogen, lipid and protein synthesis. Due to its role as a central regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism, AMPK is considered to be a key therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1403 CPTAC Assay Portal]	Insulin,ADIPOR2,p85-a,p70S6Ka,LKB1,CPT1B (muscle),GYS1(muscle),p55-y,ADRA1A,P53,AMPKa1,MO25,TSC2,CPT1C (brain),AMPKy3,AMPKa2,ADRA1B,FA Synthase,GEF,p110-b ,PFK2,PI3K (III),HNF4A,ACC1,p85-b,SREBP1,Akt2,PRKACB,STRADA,Akt1,PGC-1,Cyclin A2,HuR,ADIPOR1,CCNB1,Raptor,PLCB1,GYS2 (liver),p70S6Kb,CPT1A (liver),ACC2,PRKACG,4E-BP1,p21,AMPKy1,Adiponectin,INSR,GLUT4,eEF2K,AMPKb2,TSC1,HMG CoA Reductase,MEF2B,Leptin,STRADB,mTOR,CAMKK2,p110-a,CAMKK1,AMPKy2,HSL,p110-y,p110-d,Cyclin A1,LEPR,Torc2,AMPKb1,eEF2
Endochondral Ossification	Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcription factors that play critical roles in regulation of chondrocyte gene expression under the control of these extracellular factors include Runx2, Sox9 and MEF2C. The invasion of cartilage matrix by the ossification front is dependent on its resorption by members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, as well as the presence of blood vessels and bone-resorbing osteoclast (Mackie et al.)Thyroid hormone and especially triiodothyronine induce morphological hypertrophy of chondrocytes, through binding to thyroid hormone receptors. Further, triiodothyronine increases the total collagen production in chondrocytes, as also terminal differentiation, but triiodothyronine also induces cell death through non-apoptotic modes of physiological death. Triiodothyronine acts by altering intracellular gene expression after receptor binding, and is crucial for growth, as receptor deficiencies lead to dwarfism and growth retardation. Thyroid hormone inhibits the PTHR1 gene, which encodes for a g-protein coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-like hormones. PTH receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. They control the levels of calcium in the blood and thus, ossification as they inhibit hypertrophy upon activation (Mackie, Randau, https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/jansen-type-metaphyseal-chondrodysplasia/ )Oxygen acts upon RUNX2 and HDAC4 in the ossification process. HDAC4 is a class II histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family gene, and if tethered to a promoter, it represses transcription (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9759). Via this mechanism, HDAC4 represses RUNX2 in the ossification process. RUNX2 is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, encoding a nuclear protein with an RUND DNA-binding domain. It induces osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis, as it acts upon the DNA and regulatory factors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/860). Thus, RUNX2 acts directly upon chondrocytical hypertrophy.Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) act upon protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins if activated. In this case it leads to the inhibition of Sox9 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3314). Sox9 induces cell proliferation and inhibits hypertrophy and is regulating the transcription of the anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP474 CPTAC Assay Portal]	SOX6,C4ST1,Growth hormone,PLAU,ADAMTS1,VEGFA,Cathepsin L2,PLAT,MGP,TIMP3,TNAP,PTCH,AKP2,THRA,ADAMTS5,COL10A1,FGF2,KIF3A,PTCH1,Osteopontin,MEF2C,GLI3,IGF2,BMP7,TG737,BMP6,IGF1R,FGFR1,NPP1,RUNX2,PKA,ADAMTS4,TGFB2,Bapx1,MMP9,STAT5,SLC38A2,RUNX3,Carminerin,PTH,IHH,FrzB-1,CAB39,SOX5,Sox9,SERPINH1,PTHrP,IGF1,Adseverin,FGF18,HDAC4,GH receptor,COL2A1,STAT1,CALM1,PTHR1,AKT,BMPR1A,TGFBI,HMGCS1,MMP13,TGFB1,CDKN1C,Aggrecan,FGFR3,DDR2
Leptin signaling pathway	Leptin is a peptide hormone mainly synthesised and secreted from adipocytes. It is also expressed in other tissues including placenta, stomach and skeletal muscle. Leptin mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, leptin receptor (LEPR). LEPR belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptor. LEPR is expressed in many tissues such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, placenta, lung and liver. Alternative splicing of LEPR results in six different isoforms, LEPRa, LEPRb, LEPRc, LEPRd, LEPRe and LEPRf. LEPRb is the longest isoform and possess signaling capacity. The role of other isoforms in leptin signaling is not clear. Leptin plays a major role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin is found to be transported to various regions of the brain across blood brain barrier. Impairment in leptin signaling across the blood brain barrier induces leptin resistance and thus obesity. Leptin is known to regulate reproduction, bone homeostasis and immune signaling. Leptin is also implicated in various physiological processers such as angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. LEPRb forms a homodimer and binds to leptin in 1:1 stoichiometry. This tetrameric receptor/ ligand complex appears to be essential for signaling. Leptin receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity. It mediates multiple signaling pathways by binding to cytoplasmic kinases such as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). Activation of JAK2 by leptin promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb at Tyr-986, Try-1078 and Tyr-1141, thus activating LEPRb. Activation of leptin receptor with leptin activates signaling modules such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MAPK, IRS1/PI-3K, PLCγ and AMPK/ACC modules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb induces binding of STATs to LEPRb. Binding of STATs to the phosphorylated residues of LEPR leads to the JAK2 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus and induces expression of genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). SOCS3 mediates feedback inhibition of leptin pathway by binding to Tyr-986 residue of LEPR. Cytosolic PTP1B also negatively regulates leptin pathway by dephosphorylating JAK2 and STAT3. Binding of leptin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation of PTPN1. Phosphorylated PTPN11 provides a docking site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of ERK module through RAS-RAF-MEK signaling. Leptin induces the activation of PI-3K by promoting the interaction and formation of SH2B/JAK2/IRS complex. Activation PI-3K mediates the activation of activation of protein kinases such as protein kinase B (AKT1) and downstream signaling cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and phosphodiesterase 3A, cGMP-inhibited (PDE3A). Activated AKT also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3A/B) proteins. IkappaB kinases (IKKs) are activated in response to AKT activation. Activated IKKs induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Leptin also regulates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. AMPK function as energy sensor and is activated in response to rise in AMP to ATP ratio. Activated AMPK regulate fatty acid biosymthesis by regulating the activity the enzyme, fatty acid biosynthesis-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). PLC gamma is activated in response to leptin signaling.

Galanin receptor pathway	Galanin, a 29-30 amino acid neuropeptide named to be so, as a glycine residue occupies the position at N-terminal and an alanine residue at C-terminal. Galanin is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems in mammalian species. The galanin family of peptides includes ‘GMAP’ (Gaalanin- Message associated peptide), ‘GALP’ (Galanin-like Peptide), and its splice variant ‘Alarin’ along with Galanin. There are three known G-protein coupled receptor subtypes of Galanin, namely, GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. Galaninergic signaling is predominantly inhibitory which mainly involves MAPK, AKT, AC pathways Galanin peptides have a wide range of non-neuronal functions as well as classic neuromodulatory roles, therefore it is recommended to consider as regulatory peptides. Galanin in general is associated with several biological functions such as arousal and sleep regulation, nociception, learning, inflammation, feeding, and neuroendocrine regulation. It is also implicated in diseases like Alzheimer’s, depression, epilepsy, mood disorders, stress, anxiety, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pain.The creation of this pathway is described in [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136286/ Gopalakrishnan et al.]

The other half on the right-hand side is the CDP-ethanolamine pathway which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the phospholipid product phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP-choline_pathway Wikipedia]	CHPT1,PCYT1A,CEPT1,PTDSS2,PTDSS1,PEMT,CHKB,CHKA,ETNK1,PCYT1B,SGPL1,Pisd,ETNK2,PCYT2
Estrogen Receptor Pathway	The estrogen receptor is a nuclear receptor that is activated upon ligand binding and subsequently translocates to the nuclear.

ATM Signaling Network in Development and Disease 	This pathway is modeled after Figure 4 in the article "The ATM signaling network in development and disease" (See Bibliography).  When DNA is damaged, DDR begins to work on recuperating the damage through the appropriate cellular programs such as transcription, translation, etc etc. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase acts as the main core of this pathway acting upon or receiving a lot of the reactions towards other gene products. ATM substrates use several different cell cycle checkpoints to determine the health of the DNA, and determine different types of disease/damage done to the DNA. The p38MAPK which is a reaction by ATM later leads to HSP27 which inhibits oxidative stress within the cell. DDR and ATM both work to help the cell recover from any damage it has received and understanding how ATM works will help increase doctors and scientists understanding of diseases, and their treatment.

Toll-like Receptor Signaling Pathway	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a critical part of the innate immune response, and are expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. TLRs are pattern-recognition receptors, and recognize molecules derived from microbes. Once activated, TLRs result in activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory moleculesTLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NFkB and MAPK; and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NFkB and MAPK.Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP75 CPTAC Assay Portal].

PPAR signaling pathway	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has three subtypes (PPARalpha, beta/delta, and gamma) showing different expression patterns in vertebrates. Each of them is encoded in a separate gene and binds fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPARalpha plays a role in the clearance of circulating or cellular lipids via the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. PPARbeta/delta is involved in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation.

One Carbon Metabolism	This one-carbon metabolism pathway is centered around folate. Folate has two key carbon-carbon double bonds. Saturating one of them yields dihydrofolate (DHF) and adding an additional molecule of hydrogen across the second yields tetrahydrofolate (THF). Folates serve as donors of single carbons in any one of three oxidation states: 5-methyl-THF (CH3THF; reduced), 5,10 methylene-THF (CH2THF; intermediate) and 10-formyl-THF (CHOTHF; oxidized). The single carbon donor CH3THF is used to convert homocysteine into methionine which can then be used to methylate DNA, the donor CH2THF is used (along with a molecule of hydrogen at the site of one of the double bonds) to convert dUMP (deoxyuridylate) into dTMP (thymidylate) and the donor CHOTHF is used to set up ring closure reactions in de novo purine synthesis. CH3THF is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions. Purines are used both in RNA synthesis and in DNA synthesis and dTMP is synthesized srtictly for DNA synthesis, be it for DNA repair or DNA replicationThe folate pathway is central to any study related to DNA methylation, dTMP synthesis or purine synthesis.Differential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer. The pathway is also illustrative of the role of a number of B vitamins, including vitamin B12 (cobalamine) which is important for the sythesis of folate (vitamin B9) and of methionine.

T-Cell antigen Receptor (TCR)  Signaling Pathway	The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, the α and β chains, and a signaling subunit, namely the CD3ε, γ and δ chains and the TCRζ chain. This complex participates in T-cell activation upon the presentation of the antigen peptide (derived from the foreign antigen) bound to the MHC (Class I and Class II) residing on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD2, CD28, CD4, CD8, and integrin molecules, contribute to signal transduction by modulating the response threshold. All the above components along with accessory proteins essential for MHC are a part of the immunological synapse that initiates T-cell activation.Protein tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, in turn regulated by CD45, is the initial event in TCR signaling. Lck is activated by the interaction of MHC and CD4 or CD8. It then induces the phosphorylation and activation of TCR-CD3 complex and eventually mediates Fyn activation. The activated Src kinases phosphorylate ITAMs (Immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present on CD3γ, δ, ε and ζ chain. The 70-kd ζ chain–associated protein kinase (ZAP70) is then recruited to the ITAMs followed by its phosphorylation and subsequent activation which results in further amplification of the response. These activated PTKs induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including the transmembrane adaptor LAT (Linker Activator for T-Cells). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation subsequently leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including ERK (Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), NF-κB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) and NFAT(Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells) pathways, which ultimately induce effector functions.CD28 ligation by B7-1 or B7-2 helps in bringing the T-Cell and Antigen Presenting Cell membranes into close proximity. This event also provides a co-stimulatory signal leading to the production of IL-2 and T- cell activation. Besides CD28, many other transmembrane receptors also modulate specific elements of TCR signaling. CD28 and CD45 activate Lck which in turn induces the phosphorylation and activation of the TCR-CD3 complex and consequently, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and ZAP70. CD45 plays a role in antagonizing the effect of inhibitory proteins on T-cell activation. ZAP70 induces activation of LAT (Linker for Activation of T-Cells), an integral membrane adaptor protein which further binds to GADS (Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein-2-Related Adaptor Protein-2), SLP76 (SH2 Domain-Containing Leukocyte Protein-76), and ITK (IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase). This complex facilitates the activation of PLCG1 (Phospholipase-C-Gamma1) that is responsible for the production of the second messengers DAG (Diacylglycerol) and IP3 (Inositol Triphosphate). DAG activates proteins including PKCθ (Protein Kinase-C-Theta) and Ras, whereas IP3 leads to Ca2+ release from ER and also facilitates influx of extracellular calcium. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates the phosphatase Calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT which then enters the nucleus and promotes transcription.Activated LAT also binds multiple adaptor proteins including GRB2, GRAP (GRB2- Related Adaptor Protein) and GADS to facilitate activation of serine/threonine kinases such as Raf1, MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase) and dual-specificity kinases ERK1/2 that are involved in activation of MAPKs (Mitogen activated protein kinases) resulting in the induction of transcription factor Elk1.ZAP70 also activates IKKs via the CARD11 (Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11) -BCL10 (B-Cell CLL/lymphoma-10)-MALT1 (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Gene-1) complex and MAP3K (activated by PKCθ) which in turn relieve NF-κB of IκB (NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta) and allow its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. ZAP70 also activates p38 via Vav, Rac and MKK3/6 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-3 / Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-6). p38 then activates the transcription factor ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor-2).  Activated Rac also activates JNK via MEKK1 and MKK4/7 (MKK4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-4/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-7) which eventually leads to activation of c-Jun mediated transcription.SIT (SHP2-Interacting Transmembrane Adaptor Protein) and CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4) are transmembrane adaptor proteins that interact with the SHP2 (SH2-containing Protein tyrosine Phosphatase-2) and negatively regulate T-cell activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Fyn and CD28 respectively. CTLA4 has a greater affinity for its B7-1/B7-2ligands in comparison toCD28 and thus competes for them. During T-cell activation CTLA4 is endocytosed to quicken the response. ZAP70 facilitates translocation of CTLA4 to the membrane when the response needs to be controlled. PAG (Phosphoprotein Associated with Glycosphingolipid Microdomains), a transmembrane adaptor molecule is associated with CSK (c-Src Tyrosine Kinase), an inhibitor of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses.  Dual specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) or VHR is also induced by ZAP70 which consequently down regulates ERK activation and thus controls T-cell response.Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tcr_pathway.html NetSlim] database.	
Toll-like Receptor Signaling related to MyD88	This pathway is based on the figure 1 of "Genetic variation in TLR or NFkappaB pathways and the risk of breast cancer: a case-control study" (see bibliography). TLR and NFkB are important in inflammation in the body and in the cancerous cells. TLR signaling pathways are usually connected with MyD88 dependent pathways and MyD88 independent pathways.

Arachidonate Epoxygenase / Epoxide Hydrolase	The cytochrome P450-dependent formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid epoxides is an important biochemical pathway creating mediators of inflammation and blood pressure regulation.  Once formed these compounds can be incorperated into phospholipid membrance, and released by the action of phospholipase A2.  The epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The 11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.  Recent development of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase are proving to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-nociceptive properties.  Reports of enzyme catalyzed glutathione-conjugates of the epoxy fatty acids have been reported, but the activity and relavance of these potential metabolic products are unknown to date.

B Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway	The functional B-cell receptor is a multi-protein complex consisting of an antigen binding subunit and a signaling subunit. The antigen binding subunit is the membrane bound immunoglobulin and the signaling subunit consists of the IgÎ± and IgÎ² proteins, which are covalently bound to each other. Both IgÎ± and IgÎ² proteins have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in its cytoplasmic region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation of signaling. Antigen binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of both the immunoglobulin and the IgÎ±/Î² subunits. This results in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM motif of the IgÎ±/Î² subunits by the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in the proximity of the BCR as a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their acetylation. The N-terminal region of the kinases can also interact with the non-phosphorylated ITAMs of IgÎ±. This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result of accumulation in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps in amplifying the BCR mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated IgÎ±/Î² ITAMs are necessary for efficient recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then phsophorylates the adapter molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as molecular scaffold for the recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation of multiple signaling pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLCÎ³2 which results in optimal phosphorylation and activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links BCR to Ca2+ signaling. Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering also results in the the activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This activation takes place through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to CD19 co-receptor, which is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif. Alternatively, PI-3K can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules including PIK3AP, CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine kinase, is recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain where it is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences: Forkhead transcription factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to its inhibition and hence regulation of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB is also found to be activated in BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent manner.BCR engagement can also result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with either SHC or BLNK, which results in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This cascade leads to the activation of transcription factors including ELK and MYC. BCR activation also results in the activation of JNKs and p38MAPKPlease access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/bcr_pathway.html NetSlim] database.If you use this pathway, please cite following paper:Kandasamy, K., Mohan, S.
